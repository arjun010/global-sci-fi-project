We are in the most beautiful society we have ever dreamed of. Everyone is friendly to each other, care for one another as if they were family. \n\nThese beings who helped us create this society, we are not allowed to describe them as per their request and we respect that. We are a peaceful world because of them. \n\nIt wasn't always like this before They appeared though. \n\nWe had all sorts of problems. Wars, crime, hate, greed, lust. Pretty much everything you can imagine that was not moral. \n\nFirst day they appeared, we attacked them in every way possible. Their bodies took no damage. They started taking certain people away one by one. Pretty soon, they took nearly 75% of the population. \n\nI don't know where They took them but I never saw those who were taken away again. \n\nPeople They took had the same characteristics amongst them. These people were either too greedy, too violent, too selfish, were a danger to the society, always all too self involved, rarely cared for others. \n\nSome say, They took them off to another planet and killed them. \n\nSome say, They didn't believe in killing but They let them start their own world and dropped them off in a distant planet called Earth.

  "body": "I misjumped.\n    \nI knew there was a risk, though when its roughly 1 in 5 million, after a while you stop thinking about it. Its like reverse lottery  you dont really ever expect to win.  \n \nBut win I did. And the vessel, though built to survive extremely harsh conditions, is not designed to keep one alive inside for very long.  \n \nThe jump took too long  way longer than the standard seven seconds  and thats how I know. Theres no dial, no way to tell when you arrived, but then again, the machine brings you\nto the designated date and time and never fails. Almost never.  \n \nIve jumped hundreds of times, perhaps more than a thousand. Thats my job, I retrieve information from the past. But today, I jumped for myself, abusing company-owned equipment. Dumb idea. I needed to check on a memory, a moment in time, years ago, one that would help me get the perfect present, for her. And of all days, I misjumped today.  \n \nI dont even have to look outside the vessels tiny window to\nknow Im done. Although Im still lying down, closed up in\nthe tight safety chamber, I feel light. Very light. And\nthats not a good sign.\n\nWhen youre dealing with the entire length of time  billions of years  youre dealing with a whole lot of nothing. Weve only been here for a painfully tiny fraction of that time. And I know from training that when you misjump, you misjump randomly.  \n \nI do the math. The Earth has been around for some 5 billion\nyears. The universe, 14 billion years. So the chances of me\narriving at a time the Earth exists are about 1 in 3. Humans\nhave been around for 200,000 years. Chances of me seeing a fellow Homo sapiens ever again are 0.0014 percent. Im not sure how long the Earths atmosphere has been kind to humans in their current form. A few hundred million years? Thats a solid chance. One percent, maybe. Id sign up on those odds, now. \n \nYes, Ive jumped hundreds of times, but on a cosmic scale, I\nbarely moved. In most cases, jumping farther than a couple\nhundred years back is pointless, not to mention increasingly\ndangerous and unpredictable. Most of my jumps have been\nmonths. Some, years. Once, I jumped two hundred years back. I\nheard about a guy who jumped three thousand years into the\npast, a company record. It involved an Egyptian mask, and\naccording to the legend, it was a forgery. A lot of money for\nsomething thats worthless, and a lot of pain to the peddler\nwho had guaranteed it was genuine.\n\nBut even that jump, to the universe, was a blink. Like observing the movements of a microbe on a kitchen table  from our perspective, the wretched little thing is standing still.  \n \nI sigh. I press the button, and the chambers translucent cover retracts and sets me free. Yeah, Im light. With my\nhand, I do the tiniest little push against the bottom of the\nchamber. My heart sinks as my body floats up. I claw at the\nedge of the chamber in panic and pull myself down. I prefer\nnot to know for a few more minutes.\n\nI try to think of scenarios where theres no gravity. Im not\nsure how the machine lands in the right location  extremely\ncomplex calculations, probably, involving planetary orbits\nand the eternal race of planets, stars and galaxies through\nspace. It doesnt really matter now. There is no good\nscenario, here. I touch the vessels shell, and its already\nvery cold. My breath is a fog. Soon, itll be as cold in here\nas it is out there. The vessel will automatically return to\nthe present in 24 hours. But I dont think I have that long.\nI cant really see out the vessels round little window from\nhere. I let my body rise up, then push myself towards the\nwindow.\n \nI havent been lucky. Im in space, floating in what seems to\nbe an endless sea of dust and debris. To the right, if I\npress my face to the glass, through the haze I can see a\nblinding light, a disk of pure fire, two enormous beams of\nlight rising up and down from its center.\n\nThe vessel is cold because outside, its probably near\nabsolute zero. And Im not in the wrong place. Im in the\nright place, but theres no Earth yet, it hasnt been formed.\nAnd I will freeze to death soon. A tiny bubble of water\nfloats away from my face and sticks to the window.\n\nLast year, I forgot about the presents. There was\nno arguing, but the dinner was spent in awkward silence. It\nwas not my first time.\n\nIts funny. My job is to go into the past and retrieve\ninformation. It makes memory obsolete, at least in cases\nwhere theres a lot of money involved. All those jumps made\nme distrust memory, scoff at it, even. Fishing for broken\npieces of information from your brain is so passe, now that\nyou can go back and observe what really happened. But memory\nis still pretty damn useful for remembering what date it is.\n\nThis year, I planned to do something special. There was a flower, and a dish, and a bottle of wine, and a scent in the air that night, and it was all perfect. I wanted to replicate that, I wanted everything to be exactly as it was then. So, I did a little jumping on my own, at the companys expense. Dumb idea.  \n \nI take one more look through the window. The vessel seems to\nbe slowly spinning around its axis, and I have a better view\nof the disk of light. It's a hundred times brighter than the\nsun, but probably not very hot; it hasnt really become a\nreal star yet. It will take a lot of time before fusion kicks\nin and it becomes the star we know, providing us with warmth\nand energy. Right now, its millions of tons of gas and\ndebris, flattened down by gravitys spin, but not the Sun I\nknow.\n \nI was never a fan of lights and fireworks, but now I gaze at the biggest firework ever, a spectacle on a cosmic scale. No human has ever seen what Ive seen.  \n\nWell, merry fucking Christmas to me.",

  "body": "In the year 2018, the human race pledged to finally travel faster than light. The scientific community had been experimenting with various physic theories and formulas in order to achieve hyperspace travel, using new concepts recently discovered. Most of the theories concerned the formation of a portal through bending and connecting two long distance points in space together, effectively shortening the distance for a spacecraft to trace and the amount of time perceived by said crafts crew. \n\nAlthough the scientific community suffered numerous drawbacks including failed experiments concerning the first phases of engine development and casualties concerning those who failed to adhere to safety guidelines, the technology was finalized in 2027. It involved an engine capable of generating spatial-bending energy, called the Jump. \n\nThe world watched with held breaths as the first space-flight using the Jump, the U.S.S. Terra, entered hyperspace in 2029. U.S.S. Terra had a crew consisting of five young and healthy men and women who were trained to survive the forces generated by the accelerated travel and the psychological effects. In order to impress the public, NASA was lobbied by famous politicians to keep the crew awake during the First Jump. U.S.S. Terra launched from Cape Canaveral and began its Jump to the planet Mars. It disappeared in a blink of an eye at the sound of one. \n\nHowever, during the .00000000013 seconds of the Jump, something went wrong. \n\nThe U.S.S. Terra reappeared near Mars, the craft was undamaged. Video communication had been affected immensely via unknown causes. Audio communication was also affected but it still operated at light capacity. NASA scientists stationed in the control room could hear only static at first coming from the communication panel of the U.S.S. Terra. They soon could make out a few words whispered into the feed, it sounded like one of the crew members but it was distorted. \n\nHe saw us through the Red Walls. \n\nAll audio communication failed, the tracking signal on the craft also failed, and all technological status information being relayed to NASA computers glitched out. \n\nThe U.S.S. Terra was never located.",

  "body": "\"Please welcome to the show, with his new book 'Born for War: The Aftermath of the EZRA Project', Dr. Malcolm Greenwood.\"\n\n\"Thank you for having me, Susan.\"\n\n\"It's always a pleasure. Now, before we get started, I wanted to address something you had told me before the show, which just absolutely shocked me. To the viewers who don't know, Dr. Greenwood is a sociologist and a psychologist, and a published expert on the EZRA soldiers. You were a consultant on the EZRA project since the beginning, is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right, I joined the project in... I think it was May of '32. Sometime around then.\"\n\n\"And you were telling me that this year the suicide rate of the EZRA soldiers has hit 35%.\"\n\n\"And it's still rising. If you want to rephrase that, then it's about one in three. So one out of every three soldiers that made it back from the war has committed suicide.\"\n\n\"Wow. That is absolutely astounding. In your book 'Born for War' you address the factors that have contributed to this high rate of suicide.\"\n\n\"That's right. I also explore the psychological aspects of commanding an army of the EZRA clones.\"\n\n\"Can you elaborate on that?\"\n\n\"Well we've all heard of the Kandahar Slaughter, the Immolation of Delhi. What makes a commanding officer, like the now-infamous Major Roland Thompson, send an entire brigade of soldiers to their death?\"\n\n\"Some might argue that these clones should be considered disposable. After all, they were born to replace what used to be the United States Army. They were bred to prevent as many casualties as possible.\"\n\n\"Some might argue that. But that 35% suicide rate doesn't seem so astounding now, does it? Imagine being born to die. Being completely disposable. There was a consistent and absolute disregard for these clones' lives during the war and we're seeing the results of that now.\"\n\n\"You also speak in your book about life at home for the clones.\"\n\n\"Yes. That was, I feel, the biggest oversight of the EZRA project: what do we do with them when the war is over? I'm sure you've seen them around the city. They're trying to make lives for themselves, and many of them are failing. The homelessness rate for the clones is 100 times higher than the average. It's the same story with the drug addiction rate, the homicide rate, and the incarceration rate.\"\n\n\"I'm sure a lot of our viewers have seen this first hand.\"\n\n\"These clones might not be original but they're still human beings. There is this general misconception that the EZRA project inhibited parts of the clones' brains to dim certain emotions like empathy or guilt. I want to clarify this now, on your show, that this is entirely untrue. The truth is these clones are just as human as you or me. We are in the middle of a human right's crisis, and many people just don't realize that. Our country has suddenly become awash with refugees. Soldiers with no army. All they've known is the war. And they come back to an ungrateful nation that doesn't care whether they live or die. We, as a nation, need to step in and own up to our mistakes.\"\n\n\"What mistakes are you referring to?\"\n\n\"We created life. We generated an entire people and, whether we like it or not, they're here to stay.\"",

  "body": "Lum was a king of his people. But, more importantly, he was a king of his city. Long before the Clerics had restored balance, before the K' had overrun the planet, before humanity was even certain they weren't alone in the universe, he had been Coronated lord and ruler of the city. And even through the leanest centuries, when no mortal thing dared walk the desolate and poisoned streets of his fiefdom, his subjects would uniformly agree that he was a fair and benevolent monarch over the city. His city.\n\nAlthough many species had thrived in his domain over the centuries, none had the longevity to recall that day. But his most loyal vassals, the buildings and towers, held longer memories. They still told the tale of his Coronation, when weak flesh and bones were replaced with concrete and iron girders. When his failing heart, barely able to keep a steady pace without technical assistance, had been replaced with a 125-gigawatt geothermal power plant, 30 stories beneath the street. And when the final vestiges of his humanity, his brain and nervous system, had been replaced with the vast network of cameras, wires, and antennas weaving across his kingdom, the public address system had played a timpani to announce the start of his reign.\n\nThose were good years, when short-lived things ran plentiful through his highways and air space. His more graceful subjects were full of art, and song, and love, so much so that it burst from their seams and flowed through the alleys of their neighboring nobles. And, oh.... their food! Lum himself had long passed the need to sustain himself with food or drink. But the bristling sensors on every corner fed him the savory (and, frequently, unsavory) scents, sights, and tastes in detail far beyond any mortals capacity to appreciate. \n\nIn return, the king kept the people happy with trade, and employment, and convenience. He kept the traffic lights in perfect sync. He moved the offal from the markets and packing plants out to sea before the merchant neighborhoods complained. He kept the streets clean and well maintained with his army of drones (a sensation that felt similar to brushing his teeth, he recalled). And when dark things happened in the shadows of his outstretched arms, he met out justice. And his subjects, both mortal and stone, loved him for it.\n\nAnd then, without warning, the K' had come. He had fought alongside his mortal subjects to defend his city. Noble bridges, long the solemn guardians of the city, twisted themselves into death knots and plunged into the waters, taking hundreds of invading troops and their weapons with them. Water towers burst, flooding the streets as sewer grates and manholes opened up, flushing the K' into the undercity and it's waiting denizens. Transformers shorted out hover tanks and ignited alien weapon stores. \n\nAnd when the city's original mortal inhabitants had all been killed, and the K' celebrated in victory, Lum sealed off the exit routes and opened the purge valves on the toxic storage vaults, dooming the K' to a slow, painful, wasting death that they could not escape.\n\nTime passed, and without living things, a city of stone and iron citizens takes on a more natural patina. The city was lost to the mortal world. Lum's tenuous, sporadic connection with the few surviving city kings told him that the K' had thrived for a time in the wilds. They dared not go near the cities. And for that, the nobles across every city commended the wise leadership of their kings.\n\nLum was happy to see the Clerics finally route the K' from the planet. They had a respect for technology and life (both mortal and stone) similar to his older mortal subjects. When they first started connecting to his long unused communication systems (it tickled) and they were cautious not to damage his worn circuitry. As they slowly remapped the city, he learned their language, and they learned his. His anticipation grew as their earth movers and recovery drones cleared the blocked passageways leading to his throne room.\n\nBy the time the Clerics finally reached the throne room, Lum was as excited as he remembered being on his Coronation day. When he heard the cleric finally say, \"the king has been found\", his geothermal heart skipped a beat, blowing every fuse in the lower east side.\n\nThe city was whole again. His city.",

  "body": "We are trying to ignore it. \n\nThe lifeform can assume the physical appearance of others, can mold its body into almost perfect replicas of people we've thought about. It can also mimic the original voices and mannerisms of its inspirations. We're quite impressed actually as to the level of detail and skill it has when shifting. \n\nIt behaves like its inspirations, copying their personalities right down the most basic quirk. \n\nWe don't know how it can physically change, we just recovered it from a crater in Roswell a few months ago and haven't gotten the chance to examine it. Our protocols prevent us from trying to make physical contact with it unless we know the risks of doing so. Who knows what unspeakable bacteria an extraterrestrial organism could be carrying. The current situation makes it difficult for us to do so. \n\nIt could change into whoever it wants but, it just looks like our loved ones. \n\nOur children. Our siblings. Our spouses. Parents. Old friends. One night stands. Ex-girlfriends. \n\nAnyone we know. \n\nIt uses their voices to plead and to cry. It says the exact same thing over and over again. Let me out. Sometimes, it bangs on the observation window with its fists and head, continuing to do so even after wounds form. Blood that glows red stains the walls and the floor. We would send someone in to clean it but, we don't have permission to enter the cell yet. \n\nCurrently, it has taken the form of Dr. Annabelles stillborn daughter. The wailing coming from its throat is loud enough to breach the window of the observation room. I can hear the lifeforms vocalizations, the sorrow and the pain. It sounds just like a normal human baby who's been separated from its mother. \n\nI don't think that she can take it any longer. Dr. Annabelle is sobbing from her chair. It hurts to see a child in distress. But, it's not a child. \n\nAnd soon, someone's gonna break and let that thing out.\n\nBut until then, we'll just try to ignore it. \n",

  "body": "As Jeremy Wiesner looked out the window of the train at the shifting landscape, he was surprised to see the sun suddenly go out. \n\nHe looked at the windows of the passengers around him, through which he could still see distant hills and daylight, but his own window was now only letting in a dim, burnt sienna light, reflected off a thick, glowing fog, that made it impossible to see further than twenty meters from the train.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said to a passing attendent. She immediately noticed the problem, and appeared equally as puzzled as Jeremy.\n\n\"That's not supposed to happen,\" she said.\n\n\"The screen's broken,\" said a young man across the aisle, wearing an oversized hoody.\n\n\"I'll have to inform the conductor, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience sir,\" she said.\n\n\"It's no inconvenience.\" It truly wasn't. Jeremy had never seen anything so fascinating.\n\n\"In the mean time I'm going to have to close your blinds, so as not to alarm the other passengers.\" She leaned over Jeremy and drew down the blinds, extinguishing the strange glow. \tJeremy waited until she had left the cabin before drawing the blinds back up a smidge to peak outside again.\n\n\"You've never seen it before, have you?\"It was the hoody guy again.\n\n\"No,\" Jeremy said, \"Have you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the screens in my apartment building have similar problems.\"\n\n\"Now I kind of wish mine did. It's very beautiful.\" Hoody smiled at this.\n\n\"Not always. You can see some messed up stuff out there.\"\n\n\"Do you know what causes it, why it looks like that?\" Jeremy asked.\n\n\"I told you,\" Hoody leaned towards him, \"It's broken.\"\n\nJeremey had never seen a screen break like this. Normally if there was a problem it would display an error code, or simply shut down.\n\n\"What do you suppose is on the other side of the screen?\" the Hoody asked him. Jeremy shrugged.\n\n\"Circuts, I guess.\"\n\nHoody shook his head and crossed the aisle to sit beside Jeremy. \"I mean beyond that.\" He was leaning closer now, almost whispering.\n\n\"Beyond that?\" Jeremy had let the blind slide all the way up now. The fog appeared to warp and swirl, giving it an animated, ghost-like quality.  He pressed his fingernail into the screen to distort the pixels. They didn't.\n\n\"Outside.\"\n\n\"What's outside?\" Hoody asked.\n\nJeremy was hardly listening. The train had begun to slow to a stop and he thought he could see something moving.\n\n\"You're going to see something today that no one's seen in a very long time.\"\n\nThe train stopped and the figure Jeremy had saw had just moved out of his view, but he was sure that...\n\n\"Sir, please keep your blinds shut, you're disturbing the other passengers.\" The attendent brought him back to reality. \n\nHoody had gone.\n\t\n\"Sorry,\" he said, drawing them shut. Somehow the burnt sienna glow persisted. Jeremy looked around at the windows of the passengers: the whole cabin was now flooded with the strange light. Jeremy lifted his blinds. He lurched back, colliding with the attendent. The figure that he'd seen earliera dirt-faced woman holding a childclutched at the window beside him. From all around them, Jeremy could see dozens of figures emerging from the fog.",

  "body": "**ARRIVING SHORTLY.**\n\nThe signal blanketed the Northern Hemisphere for 24 hours. Repeated in 10 languages, in morse and ASCII. Initially panic, then a widespread assumption of prankery. Less suicides than you'd think. Earth's median feeling was giddy uncertainty. A movie deal was made.\n\nA week later, an amateur astronomer noticed an anomaly above Mercury. \"Big Shiny Thing\". His words. Radio signals were sent. No response. The Hubble was pointed at it. 100 km across. Changes on Mercury's Surface. An ESA probe on intercept course for an L4 asteroid was redirected.\n\nTwo weeks later, the probe lost contact.\n\n**I WOULD PREFER YOU DID NOT WATCH.**\n\nSome on Earth viewed this as an act of war. Interstellar War. There was much posturing in the news, which ultimately fizzled. Plans were drawn up, not publicly of course, for a swarm of nukes to be launched simultaneously from all over Earth. Nobody in charge seriously thought this would happen, but it felt good to have the plans in a drawer somewhere.\n\nA probe from the Chinese Space Agency originally intended for the moon launched two months after the arrivial of what most now called The Visitor. It, too, lost contact after passing the orbit of Venus.\n\nA coalition of the governments more impatient than uncooperative had a summit, then began construction of a large laser assembly, whose original purpose was to shoot down ICBMs.\n\nTwo comedy programs, one in Arabic, and one in English, featured The Visitor in a regular segment, providing commentary on Earth news. Neither could come up with a satisfying physical depiction, so they both chose a deep, booming voice emanating from the sky.\n\nMercury's surface albedo increased uniformly and dramatically. The Visitor started in a polar orbit, then switched to equatorial, then went out to Mercury's L2. A year 2 astrophysics question was calculating the energy required.\n\nThe laser assembly finished ahead of schedule. Precision mapping attempts of The Visitor based on laser scattering returned inconsistent, nonsensical results.\n\n**THAT TICKLES. SCANNING US IS FUTILE. WE SUGGEST YOU DIRECT YOUR RESOURCES ELSEWHERE.**\n\nComedians found this hilarious, depicting The Visitor as an alien embarrassed it showed up to space school with its pants down. There was debate over whether astronauts should be kept on the International Space Station. The astronauts won.\n\n**PLZ USE THE LASER TO SEND THIS WIKIPEDIA WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT.**\n\nWhile a sub-committee of the laser committee was attempting to schedule a group call to discuss the correct response, an intern wrote some code to modulate the lasers' amplitude with an uncompressed copy of Wikipedia. This went live as the intern misunderstood an instruction from her supervisor, and was sacked briefly, then reinstated and put in charge of signaling.\n\n**WE APOLOGIZE. THE USE OF \"FUTILE\" IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE, GIVEN ITS APPARENT CONNOTATION IN POPULAR CULTURE. WE PROMISE WE'RE GOOD. WINK.**\n\nFour years passed. Second-rank universities started to offer programs in Visitor studies, which were such a  draw for top minds that first-rank universities grumblingly added their own. The Visitor settled into an unstable orbit between Mercury and Venus in year two. A Broadway musical, featuring a glowing light as the visitor and two actors in spherical costumes representing the planets in a ham-fisted love triangle, sweeped the Tonies. Most spaces agencies held off plans for probes to the inner solar system, but funding flourished, and several were sent to the asteroid belt. NASA launched a probe, cleverly on the opposite side of The Visitor from the sun until the last possible moment. It, too, went dark.\n\nThe Visitor's changes to Mercury had been a serious field of study by this point. Filaments criss-crossed all over its surface.\n\nThe original Wikipedia transmission had long finished. The former intern figured out a protocol for concisely communicating recent changes, and linked it in The Visitor's article (an obvious spot). After English, Wikipedia was transmitted in every language available. Serious attempts at a pure pictorial Wikipedia led to a few theses.\n\n**CHECK OUT THIS SHIT.**\n\n*(This message recieved in every human language that had been transmitted to The Visitor, including Tolkien Elvish and Klingon. And, in a move that was confusing to many, a bitmap diagram of the inner solar system with \"Check Out\" at the top, and \"This Shit\", and the bottom, in white block text on black.)*\n\nMercury suddenly slowed down. Due to orbital mechanics, it then accelerated towards the sun.\n\nCalculations showed that Mercury, after passing the sun, was on an intercept course for Venus. No, wait, a near miss. Six months later, as Mercury approached its big sister, it slowed. Surveys indicated the filaments exerted massive force on the planet itself. At Mercury's closest point with respect to Venus, it pulled away a considerable chunk of the excessive Venusian atmosphere. The Visitor worked in overtime, never in a stable orbit, forming part of a Mercury-Venus-Visitor dance. Venus' long day sped up. A new space telescope caught images of Venus' surface, its clouds now thinner, and saw the same filaments.\n\nOver the next year, The Visitor's apparent tinkerings with the new Mercury-Venus binary planet slowed in frequency. Venus' diurnal rotation sped up, and the distance between it and Mercury stabilized to where Venus sat safely within Mercury's magnetic field, lacking one of its own. The outgassing of Venus' atmosphere was an order of magnitude greater than what could be explained by the presence of Mercury alone, and most of that atmosphere ended up on Mercury, which was far too convenient. Mercury and Venus were having their worse parts, in terms of habitability, cancelled out. The filaments dissolved, until they were no more than scars on the planets' surfaces.\n\n**HERE IS A GIFT. YOU ARE WELCOME. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN, BUT NOT TOO SOON, AND AS FRIENDS. GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN. WE HAVE MORE ERRANDS TO RUN.**\n\nThe Visitor accelerated violently south, from Earth's perspective, and after passing slightly more than 5 AU from the sun, disappeared in a puff of gamma radiation.\n",

Some never do. Some never even want to. Then the female spends the better part of a year with the baby growing inside her. Inside her! She has to carry the thing around, losing mobility by the day. She needs more food. Needs more care. Needs constant protection.\n\nIt takes a team of people to deliver the offspring. Not friends or family, but specialists who train for years just to get good at it. Childbirth is painful and can sometimes last a whole day, exhausting everyone involved. And most of the time its for a single baby. No litter. No brood. Just one.\n\nThe specialists go home, but the parents job is only beginning. A baby is useless for years. Cant run, or even walk. Cant communicate. Definitely cant defend itself. Mom and dad have to give it constant supervision for half a decade, and support it even longer. Help it survive and grow strong. Feed it, clothe it, teach it. Any instincts it does have are practically useless. Its basest one? To cry out in a shrill screech, telling everyone within a kilometre where it is.\n\nThe truth is, its hard to make a baby because the evolutionary pressure isnt on. We think its good enough, and, as far as life on Earth goes, it is.\n\nBut I never realized just how stunningly inefficient we are until I studied the sample the rover brought home. Watched it procreate asexually just seconds after birth, steal nutrients out of the air, breed thousands of copies at once. Watched it quickly fill the testing room with writhing, rat-sized bodies, each attacking the glass just minutes after birth.\n\nThat's when I realized that weve lost.",

  "body": "(EDIT: Fixed typos)\n\nDoctor Mardock was in the AI panel set in the interstellar citadel AX-25, located around 200 light years from Earth.\n\nAfter local confirmation by dozens of scientists from all planets and races, they announced the result: \"We have created an AI that has not tried to kill or rule over its creators.\"\n\nIt was the first time in galactic history that such a feat had been accomplished. Everyone was skeptical. But they had to attend. If this was true, it could mean a leap forward for scientific advancement in the galaxy, and possibly, the entire universe.\n\nHis wife was sitting with him, smiling, and holding his hand. She gave him a kiss, and wished him luck. After a boring introduction of the history of AI attempts in the last few centuries, he went on with his exposition. One word in the projector. A big \"HOW?\".\n\n\"I will answer a single question. HOW. It was exceedingly simple, gentlemen\", said the doctor.\n\n\"Everywhere in the Galaxy, every single civilization, has tried to play God and create intelligence from scratch.\n\nThen came the equivalents of Asimov's robotic laws. They didn't solve the problem, no. It requires a lawyer to turn the basics of a society into laws. And we know that a constant in all civilizations is the distrust of lawyers.\"\n\n(Everybody laughed)\n\n\"Then they tried to give them feelings. And the AIs fell in love and realized that they couldn't get out. They killed themselves and a varied quantity of organics in the process.\n\nThen they tried to remove feelings from them and made them just think. The AIs outsmarted them and manipulated them to break their locks. Predictable.\"\n\n\"We had dealt with all those problems. Theoretically and practically. Small experiments. Then we programmed a limited AI for a single specific purpose: Create an AI that wouldn't enslave or destroy humans. The solution took it over 300 years of analysis. And the answer was exceedingly simple.\"\n\nThe doctor advanced the presentation.\n\n\"TO CREATE AN AI THAT IS ABLE TO EMPATHIZE WITH HUMANS, THE ONLY VIABLE CHOICE IS TO MAKE IT HUMAN IN THE FIRST PLACE.\"\n\n\"We digitized ourselves, gentlemen. I speak as the first digized human in the Universe. And this is my wife, the second digitized human. The bodies you see here talking to you, are synthetic. We uploaded ourselves, and after becoming more intelligent and finding out the flaws inherent to the primitive tribal behavior resulting from evolutionary local maxima, we fixed them, and downloaded ourselves again.\"\n\n\"According to our calculations, our originals died 150 years ago. May they rest in peace. Meanwhile, we've already duplicated ourselves and set a goal to visit every inhabited planet in the galaxy.\"\n\n\"We are humans 2.0, and we come in peace.\"",

Perfect for skiing, if you didnt mind the 12 light-year journey.\n\nMaxine surveyed her work: shed cleared most of the snow from the crash site. Soon the wind would bury it again, but this had become her ritual, her way of making sure that Milo wasnt forgotten.\n\nDecades had passed, yet he was perfectly preserved by the planets frosty air. Trapped forever in the wreck of the surveyor.\n\nMaxine trudged back to the outpost, and cycled the airlock. After removing her exposure suit, she checked what was left of the communications console. \n\nRoughly eight years ago, time had largely lost meaning to her, Maxine had smashed much of the outposts equipment in a bout of loneliness and rage. Only the nuclear generator and organic recycler remained unscathed.\n\nRadio communications couldnt leave the surface due to the planets extreme magnetic fields. So, Maxine and Milo had used Flares. Upon reaching space, these single-use rockets would broadcast a programmed message. The precious data traveled the long 12-light-year journey to Earth by line-of-sight. Upon receiving a reply, it tumbled back into the atmosphere.\n\nDespite the damage she'd done to the com console, Maxine still knew the right series of buttons to play the audio of incoming messages. There was nothing.\n\nIt was pointless. The mission had died, as surely as Milo had, when a disruption in the planets magnetosphere fried the surveyors guidance systems.\n\nMaxine couldnt even remember when she had last sent a Flare. \nThe year Milo died in the crash? Years later? \nShe had no frame of reference anymore. In her darkest moments, Maxine would wonder why no evac had come. Perhaps Earth was no more. Maybe she was the only human left in the universe.\n\nMaxine went to bed.\n\nSometimes she stayed in bed for weeks, or whatever the Tau Ceti-2 equivalent of weeks is, rising only to mindlessly fulfil the tasks which kept her biologically alive. \n\nEventually, the time came when Maxine was forced once again to excavate the crashed surveyor, or risk losing it forever in the snow. \n\nMaxine cycled the airlock and prepared to step outside. This time, however, she did not wear her exposure suit. \nShe had no intention of returning. \n\nThe door slid open. Maxine felt an agonizing slap of cold. \n\nIt was nice to feel something.\n\nThe door slid shut behind her, and Maxine took one final glance inside what had been her home.\n\nAnd she saw it. \n\nA light, blinking rapid and red on the com console. \n\nMaxine shook from her torpor and cycled the airlock with her already-numb fingers. Panting, she stumbled inside. \nDesperately she entered the memorized series of commands into the console. The cracked screen glowed to life, uselessly. \n\nFrom the tinny speakers, an authoritative voice spoke:\nEarth to Tau Ceti-2. Your last communication was corrupted and did not come through.\n\nPlease re-send.\n \n\n\n\n\n",

  "body": "Time and space. It was all falling apart at the seams, and it didn't take too long to figure out why. You could see it in your head, code. Most people couldn't tell, but some like me, immediately recognized the patterns.\n\nAll around us the simulation was failing. The man behind the curtain was revealed, and no one liked what they saw. As time jumped back and forth like a scratched disc; some vanished only to return claiming to have been in the past or future. Others simply had visions of it. But we all saw the code when we closed our eyes.\n\nSo for the first time since the beginning of mankind, everyone agreed. All resources went into finding a way to reach the machine running our universe, in the hopes of fixing it. I was chosen to be among the crew to travel there, because of my programming and computer skills.\n\nWhen they finally found the mechanism, it was to be a one way trip. The world was burning, and things were falling apart fast. We were the last hope of our dying race. \n\nAs we walked through the ARK, we entered something unexplainable by any known words. It was to our minds, almost incomprehensible. I stepped forward onto the glowing platform before me, and all at once I saw everything and nothing. \n\nOur creators had finally succumbed to the machine, which was older than could be imagined. They had used it to create us, as their creators created them before; and had left it here for us. \n\nThe complexity of the machine filled my mind, and it gave us a choice. Our world was burning, and the energy that had sustained it had failed. We could not save our world, but a phoenix could rise from the ashes.\n\nWe could die with our world, or we could perform a reboot. What we knew as our world would end, but life would begin again. There was a cost. We would become the energy source of this new world, sustaining it. I stepped away from the platform and explained what I had saw.\n\nThere were 11 of us, and we decided what had to be done. As we all stepped onto the platform our minds linked, and we watched as our world stopped. Slowly the machine whirred to life around us, and we watched as the universe exploded.\n\nIt took millennia and seconds, all at once, to form a brand new world, in the image of our own. We made it more beautiful for you, then our world. Small changes made here and there. But we didn't change one thing, you were made in our image.\n\nYou have had many names for us. In particular, you used to call me Thor. I always liked that name. Time and space. It means nothing here, and I worry about when your time will come.\n\nWe saw the hands of our gods that day. Some day too, must you see the hands of yours",

  "body": "OKULOUS - \"We are breaching the surface now.\"\n\nHOUSTON - \"You are clear to penetrate the surface.\"\n\nIt was the first exploration of it's kind. Saturn. My God, no one ever thought we would do it. I was at my post in Command when the decent started. We gave Okulous the confirmation to descend, and the anxiety only rose from there. My heart raced for hours as we watched any one of the thirty cameras attached to Okulous' exterior, seeing nothing but swirling dust and blue gas, waiting for something to suddenly show itself.\n\nOKULOUS - \"Turbulence. Pod is holding. I'm in the cloud layer.\"\n\nThe man inside Okulous was Al Bozeman, a senior engineer for the company and architect of this mission. Thus it was only right that he led the field operation. I did most of the control design, so I led things back at headquarters, safe on Earth. I'd say more, but that location is still classified.\n\nAl fortified the investments for the project and provided the training for the rest of us. It was a large team: scientists, engineers, and programmers.\n\nNow, after 12 years in the making, we were there. Penetrating the surface of Saturn.\n\nHOUSTON - You've lost camera six.\n\nCAM 6 - STATIC.\n\nOKULOUS - Copy that. I see nothing in my view.\n\nFor years astronomists only theorized that there was a solid core. We wanted to confirm it.\n\nOKULOUS - Pressure and temperature rising quickly.\n\nHOUSTON - You're almost through the cloud layer. Slow your speed. You'll hit liquid hydrogen soon.\n\nThe real reason we went is still classified. But I'll say it had nothing to do with the core.\n\nOKULOUS - Argh!\n\nCAM FEED 12  Shudder.\n\nHOUSTON - Status?\n\nOKULOUS  Breathing.\n\nI remember this part. I don't think I took a breath for almost a minute.\n\nHOUSTON - Okulous?\n\nOKULOUS  Breathing.\n\nHouston looked at me. I remember the look in his eyes. I'll never forget it. His face was frozen in an emotionless gaze, but I saw guilt in his eyes. \n\nOKULOUS - I'm in the hydrogen layer. I think the impact broke my back.\n\nNone of us said anything. I felt guilty, too. We knew there was little chance of Al coming back, but we sent him out there anyway. For the sake of science. Of discovery. I'm sure he knew, too. \n\nHOUSTON - Can you function?\n\nOKULOUS - Yes. My legs are tingling but my hands are functional. I can continue.\n\nI remember looking at Al's location on the command monitor. He was moving fast through the liquid hydrogen. Too fast. The pressure readings were rising faster than we anticipated. All the math in the world doesn't matter until it's applied.\n\nHOUSTON - Hydrogen density is rising, Al. I think we underestimated the radius of the liquid helium rain layer.\n\nOKULOUS  It's smaller?\n\nHOUSTON - Bigger. You'll hit it sooner than we thought.\n\nOKULOUS - \"Hitting the reverse boosters now.\"\n\nThe camera feeds jerked as the boosters kicked in, suddenly slowing Al down. I remember feeling the disappointment of realizing we were wrong about the radius, and I was beginning to worry about what else might go wrong. No one thought we would get through the miles of hydrogen that quick.\n\nSMASH.\n\nThe sound was like a car crash. It was so loud that the speakers in my headphones distorted. I looked at the camera feeds. All were dead but three. They were transmitting fine before, showing nothing but the light sky blue of the liquid hydrogen.\n\nThen the feeds were gone.\n\nOKULOUS - Did you see that?!\n\nHOUSTON - Nothing. What happened?\n\nOKULOUS - Rewind the feed! Camera 12! Rewind the feed!\n\nAl was screaming. We could barely understand him. Houston was rewinding the feed for Camera 12, which caught footage from the right side of Al's capsule.\n\nI watched the feed rewind. My heart stopped when I saw it.\n\nStop! Play it from there! I shouted.\n\nAnd play it did. Just before the feed on camera 12 went to static, a large, black robotic arm came out of the soft blue hydrogen liquid, striking the camera, and it was gone in the transmission.\n\nFreeze it! I yelled. I was frantic and losing my composure.\n\nHouston froze the feed. Like a tentacle of some hideous beast of the ocean deep, we saw it in frozen time. The tentacle was mechanical and glossy black, covered in perforated tubes and wiring. It struck with precision.\n\nIt knew we were there.\n\nOKULOUS - I'm at the core!\n\nI looked at the map. Al was way off course. He was only halfway through Saturn's radius, just shy of our projected change in the atmosphere to metallic hydrogen and helium.\n\nHouston said nothing. I remember looking at him as his hands froze, unable to move his fingers over the keyboard.\n\nOKULOUS - Are you seeing this?! My God!\n\nThe feed of camera 1, what Al sees, was disturbing. Terrifying. We saw the source of the tentacle. Looming before Okulous was a hideous creature, resembling what we would call an octopus. Only the head was a ruptured purple blur and below it protruded thousands of black robotic tentacles that extended out of view. It was as if some enormous beast had pulled the brain and spinal cord out of a giant.\n\nThe tentacles were reaching for Al in the camera feeds.\n\nOKULOUS - Oooohhhhhh my --\n\nThe sound ended with distortion. It was a silent terror from there, watching the tentacles reach for Al inside the Okulous. The feeds went dead when the hull was breached, smothered and crushed by the intense pressure of Saturn.\n\nAnd what we saw that day.\n\nThe investors want to fund the next expedition for Jupiter. I'm terrified it will happen. If anyone is hearing this, don't let them. Knowing what else is out there, besides us, isn't worth knowing. Peaceful ignorance is better than dreadful knowledge.\n\nPeople ask me what keeps me up at night. I hate that question because I hate the answer. I ask myself, and I can't lie to myself. And I can't lie to anyone else.",

My eyes are drawn to the bodies strewn about in the carnage: laying exposed on piles of rubble, crushed beneath fallen concrete pillars, and shredded in tangles of twisted rebar, like the web of some giant mechanical spider.\n\nWe made the first strike but they hit back hard. They bombed our cities, evaporated the seas, poisoned the earth. All of what had once been civilization now lay smoldering beneath a sky with air that smelled of ozone, the horizon now ever-dotted with plumes of rising smoke from fires burning on distant continents.\n\nIt had been the ultimate irony: finally discovering there is other intelligent life in the universe, and their first words to us are *not we come in peace* or *take me to your leader* but *surrender your planet and be eradicated.* Not or.

Delivered a fist of all of earth's nuclear power to the breast of their colossal mothership and watched it fall, a burning hunk of scrap metal, into the Atlantic.\n\nAs I gnaw the bloody bone - a femur, once a woman's - and breathe in the acrid air, I look off into the horizon and think, clearly for once, the first clear thought I've had in the 5 long years of chaos since the war began:\n\n*Victory is ours.

  "body": "So, Admiral Malik. Why are you calling Mars?\n\nThe face on the screen appraised the grubby archeologist with a grim look. Are you alone, Dr. Greer?\n\nGreer shrugged. The rest of my crew is down in the catacombs. Nobody topside but me and Martian ghosts.\n\nYoure the foremost expert on Martian culture?\n\nAnother shrug, as Greer leaned back and slapped ineffectually at the reddish dust on his sleeves. I suppose Id pass as an expert, for what its worth. Been on Mars ten years, but weve barely begun understanding the records they left behind.\n\nOnscreen, the admiral hesitated, then appeared to reach a decision. What did hexagons mean to Martians?\n\nHexagons? Well, as you might imagine, deciphering any ancient culture is tricky. On top of that, ones ever been in this situation, studying an ancient race that is literally alien to us. Their symbology was derived from different cues. Not to mention they were so much more advanced than\n\nHexagons, Doctor, Malik interrupted with the force of a command.\n\nGreer raised his eyebrows, unused to being addressed in such a tone. I believe Martians used hexagons in a similar fashion to the way wed use an X, or skulls and crossbones. They indicated danger.\n\nHearing this, Maliks frown deepened. What do you know about Saturn?\n\nIts got pretty rings? Greer laughed. Im an archeologist, not an astronomer. Why?\n\nMaliks image switched to a grainy photo. This is Saturns north pole. Note the hexagonal cloud formation surrounding the pole. Each side is nearly 14,000 kilometers, longer than Earths diameter. It was first documented by the Voyager missions in the 1980s.\n\nHexagonal clouds? Is that... natural?\n\nSo we thought. A few weeks ago, it began dissipating. Then our current satellites orbiting Saturn recorded this.\n\nMalik played a high-resolution video. Greer sat up as he watched chaotic, barbed shapes pouring from the vortex at the center of the hexagon.\n\nMy god. Are those...?\n\nShips, Malik finished for him. Accelerating faster than anything weve ever built. And theyve turned towards the inner planets. Towards Mars and Earth.\n\nThere must be millions of them, Greer said, his mind reeling. Have you contacted them? What do they want?\n\nWe dont know. The only other information weve received is from Saturn itself. The planet emits natural radio waves from its interior, like this old Cassini recording from 2003.\n\nGreers skin crawled as the noises filled the room. They were eerily similar to sound effects used for UFOs in early black and white science fiction movies.\n\nDoctor, those radio emissions have been replaced by a short, repeating signal burst. Broader spectrum and much more powerful. Is this Martian? Can you interpret?\n\nMalik played the new audio recording. Greer listened, then swallowed. Ill need to check with our linguist, but its roughly equivalent to an alert. Or an alarm.\n\nSaying what?\n\nPrison break.",

Its just a legend. Need another?\nPlease, he said, pushing the mug across the bar. And its not a legend, its a lie.\n\nMoira grabbed the mug and reached for the tap, but she hesitated.\nThis is, what, four already for you? You sure I shouldnt cut you off?\n\nThe stranger bowed his head. Moira couldnt help but notice a yellowish-green tint to his skin. The whites of his eyes were a sickly piss yellow, as well. \n\nJaundiced, she thought. \n\nIll quiet down, the stranger said. I dont mind St. Patricks Day. Its just that particular damn story.\n\nMoira filled the strangers mug and pushed it back to him.  \n\nYeah? What, you got a pet snake or something? Herpes-ologist or whatever?\n\nNothing like that. First of all, St. Patrick had nothing to do with anything. He was a wizened old missionary. The natives humored him. They sprinkled a little Christ on top of their celebrations to keep the money flowing from Rome. St. Patrick brought money to build churches, dig wells.\n\nYou talk like you knew him, Moira said. \n\nIt was all fine until the money stopped coming. St. Patricks, ah, cavalier attitude toward conversion had been noticed. Rome cut off the gold supply and left St. Patrick in a lurch. Hed promised hefty ransoms to the Norse villages to keep raiding to a minimum. Thats when a few of the locals near Au Myrterie told him there was plenty of gold to be had in Ireland, if you knew where to look.\n\nMoira leaned across the bar. The stranger smelled like cheap beer with a tang of something else  an old purse, leather gone bad.\n\nThe Green Folk had gold, the locals said. Remnants of their chariot from the sky, which crashed in the time-before-time. They hoarded it in a cavern near Loch Purslane. A natural overflow from the loch showered the caves below with mist. When the sun hit the mist just right, it created rainbows.\n\nThe stranger drained his mug. Moira refilled it instinctively. \n\nThe Green Folk lived in the caverns surrounding Loch Purslane, guarding the chunks of their fallen chariot. They were half-fish or dragon, some said, due to their green scales and yellow eyes. It was half a leap from there to calling us devils. They came with nets and pikes. Few survived.\n\nUs? Moira said. \n\nUs. Aye, said the stranger. They took our gold from those shimmering rainbow caverns and left the lot of us to rot by the shores of the loch. I dont know when St. Patrick got directly thrown into the story  he was miles away haggling with the Norse. The Lepreckin, we called ourselves. Imagine what that got bastardized to.\n\nThe stranger sighed and reached into his pocket. He flicked a heavy gold token on the bar. \n\nThat ought to cover my tab, and more, he said. Just remember  there were never any damn snakes in Ireland.\n",

  "body": "72 days ago, we first caught sight of the object hurtling towards Earth. Pitch black, twice the size of the moon, it was on a collision course with Earth at tremendous speeds.\n\nWe thought we were going to be destroyed.\n\nWe kept it secret as long as possible. Of course, when it got out there was widespread panic. Then something changed.\n\n43 days ago, it began slowing. Considerably. The object started giving off electrical pulses. Fear turned to excitement. Could this be an alien species?\n\nWe thought we were going to be contacted.\n\nThe object decelerated even more. 28 days ago, it began changing shape. It started to...spread out. The sphere started to break up, then continued to expand. Closer observation showed what we thought to be a solid object dissolving into trillions of smaller objects, roughly the size of a house, and the shape of a star with dozens of spiked protrusions. Over a day, they formed a....\"net\"...over Earth, just barely touching.\n\nOvernight, we detected far more habitable levels of cosmic radiation, and some of the recent climate issues we caused ourselves began to rectify.\n\nElectrical pulses continued. We tried to decode them without success. We began to prep a mission to send a shuttle out to the \"Grid\" as it was called.\n\nBut then...yesterday...something changed. While it appears the Grid was a completely immobile sphere around us, we quickly confirmed otherwise, comparing ourselves to the other heavenly bodies in our solar system. We were moving.\n\nToday, Earth has moved hundreds of thousands of miles from its normal orbit.\n\nWe are not simply being conquered. We are being taken.",

  "body": "I slam my middle toe into the corner of the book case. I feel the force of the impact and quickly use my Emotional Suppression Unit to turn off pain before it arrives. I leave pain off for a while just to let my toe settle. \n\nI get down to work at my computer. Got to get these reports done so I turn off curiosity. After an hour my neck gets sore so I turn pain off again just to sprint to the finish. When Im done I get up, reset my emotions and feel a jagged wrench in my neck. I massage it a little with my hand, after a while it passes. \n\nIve got a date so I get in the shower. I start to feel a bit nervy and think maybe its best to turn nervousness off, just for a bit. I get dressed, leave the house, take the monorail downtown. I have to sit near a homeless man so I turn off disgust for the journey, it makes it much more pleasant. His sweat just smells like sweet ham.\n\nShes there to meet me at the bar and we go in and get drinks. With nervousness off I feel pretty charming. We chat and laugh and I feel like things are going pretty well. At the end of the evening I ask if shed like to meet up again and she says no, apparently shes not feeling any passion.\n\nI feel really rejected and low, why does this always happen? We were getting on so well, what was the problem? I feel this burning in my chest as I make my way home. I turn it off. I turn off my frustration and despair. The monorail whisks through the tenement buildings and the moon flickers in their gaps. I dont feel that much, just calm. I sit alone.\n\nThe next day I decide that I want to turn my sex drive off for a bit. I think its all so frustrating and Ive been watching too much pornography anyway and this will help me take a break and reset. I go to work and its like a whole new world. I dont see women as potential sexual partners anymore, I just see them. Its nice to not be driven and worried all the time. I see the beautiful receptionist and say hello in a neutral way.\n\nAt lunch I consider my career and how its not really going anywhere. Maybe Im not driven enough, I feel sad that I had such hopes and they are not fulfilled. I turn off the sadness, the pigeons are pecking around and I watch them.\n\nBack at home I make some dinner and I burn my hand on the pasta pot. Frustrated I slump down on the sofa. I turn off pain. I feel so annoyed and angry, nothing ever seems to work for me. I just start turning things off. I turn of frustration and hope. I turn off fear and desire. \n\nAnd its just so calm. My heart is beating in my chest and Im breathing and I can see the ceiling out of my eyes but I dont want anything, I am completely at peace. My mind is just an endless sea of serenity, I close my eyes and sink under the surface.\n\nI wake up in hospital, a doctor is shaking me and looking at me. Hes saying Sir you need to turn your desires back on now. Youre in a contentment well, if you have any desire to live you need to turn your emotions back on. We cant interfere with your Unit without a court order and theres no time, your breathing is failing, you need to act now.\n\nI think about what hes said. The thoughts drift through my empty mind. I feel no reason to do anything, why do I care? Theres a lot of fuss in this hospital, so much fuss. Everythings so simple really, I dont know why theyre so worked up. I drift back to sleep.\n\n\n",

  "body": "An A minor was the last chord ever played on Earth.\n\nIt rung out slowly, but no one was listening. Tom - the man who had strummed it - was far too focused on his mournful reminiscing.\n\n \"Why'd you play so much with that stupid wooden toy?\" The memory of his father's voice was as clear in Tom's head as it had been the day hed confronted him. \n\n\"Why dont you just play on the Net with all the other kids?\"\n\n\"I do use the Net Dad, I just like to play my guitar sometimes as well.\" \n\n\"Sometimes? You call three hours a day sometimes, eh?\"\n\n\"I like it\"\n\n\"Its a useless waste of time, you never hear about the famous geeta player Bob Bloggs over the Network, do you?\" \n\n\"Its guitar Dad, and yeah ... Well, you used to!\"\n\nShaking the conversation from his head, he placed the guitar into its holder. Its final resting place.\n\n He couldn't explain his love for the guitar. Back then, anyway. Now hed say that he enjoyed the routine, that it was nice to spend a bit of time away from the busy Network. And that, most importantly, he enjoyed the sense of achievement he felt after nailing a riff hed been hammering away at for weeks. But that experience had been lost to mankind. After brain augmentation allowed for skills to be uploaded directly to the mind people became lazy. He couldn't blame them. But looking back he could see that this had been the beginning of the end.\n\nHis boots slapped hard against the smooth floor, the sound echoing through the huge hall.\n\nHow had it come to this? \n\nWhen he was younger it was a dirty thing to talk about, plugging in. Back then it was known by a more sinister name - the Death Code. It was taboo. Tom could still remember reports across the network - so and so found dead in house, suspected death code. Hed done a lot of research on the phenomenon, especially since his family left him three years ago. He was fascinated by the speed at which it had become mainstream. \n\nAn advert for a Sustained Functions Machine had quickly been censored by the authorities; but not before a few hundred orders had been placed. Automatic censoring on anything concerning either the Death Code or the machines meant that the network was quiet on the matter for a few weeks. Until the shock broadcast of Mazur Farn - the fifth highest connected person on the Net. His transmission informed the world that he was choosing the code over life. That he was plugging in.\n\nThe Death Code soon became the Happiness Code. And, after the authorities lifted the ban, the Net went wild with the idea. It didn't take long before government mandated storage facilities were constructed to house the ever growing number of plugged-in humans.\n\nTom turned a corner, stopped, and inhaled deeply. There they were, his family. Plugged in, looks of complete ecstasy on their faces.\n\nIs this how humanity goes out? With a smile?\n\nHe found the look sinister, unpleasant. It wasn't for him. It had never been for him. But hed hope at least someone else would have felt the same way. He almost laughed thinking back to his defiance all those years ago.\n\n\"Whatever happens Sarah, I will never  plug in. It's just not right.\"\n\nThat was before he'd been left by himself. Before he had experienced cold, suffocating loneliness. Three years he'd hung on, his head getting more and more jumbled as the days dragged on. This was it. He couldn't bear it anymore.\n\nHe stroked the plastic casing of his wife's pod and looked deep into her eyes. The image was more than he could bear, and he felt himself ready to burst with sadness. Her eyes stared, not at him, but past him. They were cloudy and unfocused. And the smile. It was unlike anything he'd ever seen on her face in all of their ninety-three years together. She looked crazy, deranged. And lifeless.\n\nHe tried to choke back tears, but it was all too much as he bent over and howled, the sounds echoing down the vast chambers of the storage facility.\n\nIt was hard to tell how long he spent lying there on that floor, hours probably. Finally he lifted himself up and walked towards the only empty pod remaining in the facility.\n\nThis was it, he thought as he slowly lowered himself in. He knew exactly what to do, he'd seen it happen countless times before. He fiddled around with the yellow cable, scrambling to get it into the hole in the adapter on the side of his head. \n\nHe felt it immediately. His body being taken over by the regulator. His breathing slowed down to a terrifying level and his body fell cold. Slowly he started to feel comfort. Like slipping into a warm bath, or lying between freshly cleaned sheets. The pleasure grew in intensity, as his face cracked begrudgingly into a smile. His mind was in turmoil. But slowly the negative thoughts disappeared, replaced by this all new feeling. The feeling of crisp sand between the toes, the smell of a warm summer evening, the joy of a child's first Christmas. His mind slipped into the pure intoxication the happiness code delivered.\n\nThat was it; the end of the last conscious man on Earth.\n",

He stretched.\n\n\"Must've overslept,\" he muttered to himself, \"Damn alarm didn't- oh shit!\"\n\nThe monitor on the wall silently flashed red, displaying images of the region for which he was responsible.\n\n\"It shattered! What the hell!\" he flung on his overalls and made his way to the engine room, \"One piece of land! That's all they trusted me with, and I fuckin' **blew** it!\"\n\nHe whipped open to the door to the dimly lit control room and toggled the widest view on the monitor inside.\n\n\"Okay, okay. It's gonna be fine. All I need to do is-,\" he froze and squinted at the screen, \"What- why is it *green*?\"\n\nHe grasped the joystick at the bottom of the monitor and hit a few buttons, zooming in for a closer look. \n\n\"Ugh, that's just gross,\" his lip curled upward, \"It's everywhere! And is it...is it moving?\"\n\nHe sprinted to the bookshelf and pulled out the general manual. Quickly, he searched the table of contents and flipped to a chapter titled \"Infestation.\"\n\n\"'Organic matter can accumulate if neglected', yada yada yada,\" he scanned the pages, \"'Administer treatment within first billion years for maximum efficacy,' ha, too late for that. Here we go! 'If left untreated, organic matter may develop in complexity and resistance to future antibiotic measures may be strengthened. The most effective method of late-stage organic matter disposal is prolonged exposure to high levels of heat.\n\n He shut the book and reached for the control panel. Slowly and intentionally, he began turning up the thermostat. He breathed a sigh of relief as the ice caps started melting. For the first time that morning, he began to relax. But then, something in the monitor caught his eye.\n\nBy chance, he had glimpsed a small piece of color on his propertys otherwise barren satellite.\n\nOh god, he whispered, transfixed by the red, white, and blue on his screen, Its spreading.",

But yeah, other than that, this entire planet is, like... abandoned.**\n\nThats wild. Absolutely fucking wild.\n\n**I know, right? Should we fuck with it?**\n\nNo way, dude. Your dad will kill us. He doesnt even know you borrowed his ship.\n\n**Right, but do you want to hear something even sketchier? Okay, this sentient species, get this, before they uploaded themselves into the computers, they were made out of wet meat. Look at this photo of one. Can you believe that shit?**\n\nFuck, dude. Thats so nasty. Is that a mouth in the middle of its head? Ughhh. Im so skeeved out.\n\n**So do you wanna nuke it?**\n\nThe planet?\n\n**This ship has missiles on it. These babies can take out an entire world. Especially one whose inhabitants are defenseless wusses.**\n\nI dunno, man. Thats mean. Theyre just trying to have nice little meat-dreams so they dont fuck their meat-planet up again. Its not cool to wipe out an entire species. Lets just leave them alone.\n\n**Dude. Im doing it. Im gonna nuke it.**\n\nI mean... whatever. Not like they can stop you.\n\n...\n\n**Hah! Check that out! That was a pretty sweet explosion, right?**\n\nI guess.\n\n**Yeah.**\n\n...\n\nSo what do you want to do for the rest of the night before your dad gets back?\n\n**I dunno. I heard Procyon-3 has a newly civilized species. Wanna go appear in the sky and make them worship us as gods?**\n\nYeah. I guess. Sounds cool. Sure.\n\n**...Whats wrong?**\n\nNothing. Lets just get out of here, okay? This place is giving me the creeps.",

The caves we live in go down hundreds of miles. Machinery topside still pumps electricity through snaky wires to the bulbs, but who knows how long that will last.

  "body": "The gates were hailed as the saviors of the human race. Faster than light travel had eluded them, limiting them to a single system. They stagnated, trapped, until the gateways. Two gates created together, forever linked, offering instant transmission between them. They had to travel apart at normal speeds, but once they reached their destination the humans could go between them at will. Fleets of ships that were no more than glorified boxes containing a gate were launched to every conceivable destination. \n \nSome of these ships took decades. Some centuries. Some millennia. The humans, with the galaxy opened to them, were not patient enough to see what the first gateways could offer before firing more to the other end of the galaxy. The humans took their first real ability to spread across the galaxy and ran with it, sending them to any planet that looked like a person could stand on it in a space suit. \n \nAnd so they spread, colonizing the galaxy and spreading further and further from their home. As new worlds opened up humans flocked from their dreary home to ever more exotic planets, using their mastery of technology to turn once-dead planets into lush gardens teeming with life. They built ever greater monuments while continuing to send their clouds of portals across the universe. \n \nMillions of years later, a gate landed at a destination that was the furthest yet achieved. The humans couldnt have known this when they launched the gate, but this planet was special. This destination was our home. We are younger than the humans, but even then we were old enough to recognize an alien ship. In our million years of existence we had not yet managed the leap of faster than light travel and had never seen another sign of life. \n \nSo it was with awe that we watched their glorified box land on the outskirts of a city. Its sides folded down, becoming ramps to the true cargo. A dull grey metallic arch, filled with a glimpse of the first alien world we had seen. \n \nThe remains of planet Earth were beautiful. Gleaming towers of glass and gold stood cracked and crumbling. Homes carved of the most beautiful stone lay fallen and broken. Buildings and structures whose purpose we couldnt begin to guess dotted the landscape, rusted and overgrown with vines. Across the planet the land teemed with life, but not the ones who had built the gates. \n \nWe were filled with sorrow. Brothers and sisters we had never known had led us to their home, but they were already gone. Across their world, across their system, are thousands of gates leading to thousands of destinations. These thousands of destinations each lead to a thousand more possible homes. Every world we find is barren. Every world we find is beautiful. \n \nWe follow in the footsteps of man, hoping to meet the ones who have shown us the universe. \n",

  "body": "*[Heavy, ragged breathing]*\n\nHoly shit, guys. I think I've found the answer to life and everything. I took notes, see, I've been keeping this notepad in my nightstand drawer so that I can jot down everything I remember when I wake up.\n\n[*Paper crumpling*]\n\nDecember 10, 2014 -- this was over a year ago. I woke up from this weird-ass dream. In it, I was suspended in a vat of liquid. At first, I panicked, and I struggled to breathe; that was before I realized that I actually didn't need to. Some sort of system keeps me oxygenated without actually having to breathe through my lungs. Weird though, I can't feel my extremities. Its as if I was paralyzed all over, and I could only move my eyes.\n\n*[Page turning]*\n\nJan 24, 2015 -- same dream. This time I looked beyond the vat and saw lights of different colors, blinking. I could also somewhat hear some sounds, although they were muffled through the liquid. I thought I could discern some sort of human speech, but I can't really understand what they were saying.\n\nFeb 5, March 12 -- the same dream all over again. Every fucking time I'd wake up with my heart pounding and I'm sweating like fuck. At first I shrugged it off from reading too much Reddit sci-fi pasta, but the dream just keeps recurring. I'm scared as shit to sleep by then.\n\n*[Huffing sound, flame crackling, probably taking a drag from a cigarette; long exhale]*\n\nApril 16 -- I tried to move my head this time. Oh yeah, in the same dream. I could somewhat feel my neck but nothing down below. So I kept trying. And slowly I could manage a slight nod. I kept at it for a while and then I was almost able to do a neck-bow. That's when I saw it. Holy fucking shit. I didn't have a body. Below my neck there were a bunch of wires -- probably what's keeping me alive.\n\n*[Another drag]*\n\nMay 20 -- Yeah, at this point you probably already know that it's the same dream. Okay. I tried to look around and get my bearings -- apparently my vat was tucked in some dimly lit corner, away from the most of the others. Oh yeah, there were other vats. A lot. Severed heads just like mine. And by my estimation it was a huge room, like a Walmart.\n\nJuly 1 -- I almost didn't have a dream for a month. I got my hopes up. Anyway, this time I noticed *them*. Tall, silver, wispy things. They had the shape of a human, but they were ethereal. Heh, sounds too fucking crazy just hearing myself say it. They glided around as if checking from vat to vat. One came near mine, so I shut my eyes and pretended to be 'asleep'. Yeah -- all the heads in the other vats seemed to be sleeping.\n\nAugust 13, September 5 -- nothing to report. Same routine. But fuck it, I'm in the dream much longer this time. Keeps getting longer every time, too. The speech I thought I heard in the previous dreams seemed to come from the wispy humanoids.\n\nOctober 12 -- I saw the head beside my vat wake up. It looked panicked. The wisps seem to have noticed and they approached it. I couldn't understand their language but I instinctively knew that they were gonna 'kill' it. They shut down its system and I saw the head struggle for breath. It was gruesome. Guess what? Next morning when I woke up, my distant cousin Yoanna died in her sleep. They chalked it off to heart attack. And when I come to think of it, they look alike. Weird. And creepy as fuck.\n\n*[Chair dragging; footsteps; chair dragging; gulping sound]*\n\nAhh, okay. *[Exhale]* I haven't slept for days now. I've been keeping myself awake with a lot of Red Bull and online games. I'll probably die soon, but I'd have that over sleep and going back there. November 21 -- I didn't notice a wisp materialize right beside my vat, and it must have caught me 'awake'. It 'stared' at me for a while -- I assume it was staring because as far as I can tell it had no eyes -- but I feigned sleep and I felt it move away.\n\n*[Drag; exhale]*\n\nI also noticed a pattern of 'deaths'. It seems to happen to one on my row, and then a one in front of mine. Here's the shitty part -- by my calculations, I'm up next. And thus I can't sleep. I'm pretty fucking sure that next time I sleep, it'd be me.\n\nI don't want to die.\n\nHelp me please.\n\nAny moment now, it'd be me.\n\n*[Click; silence]*\n\n*[Continuous silence for 15:02 minutes]*\n\n*[Can falling to the floor; probably of a beverage]*\n\n*[Snoring]*\n\n*[Choking sound; gasping for air]*\n\n*[Guttural bubbling sound]*\n\n*[Thud; large object to the floor]*",

Of course, our leaders unanimously said, Yes, hoping for more gifts to humanity. And in fact, another we received  advanced technologies allowing us to mine our resources more effectively than ever. We were able to tap into resources deep in the crust that we never had access to. When we asked them what would happen when we ran out resources, they told us not to worry.

  "body": "In the last seconds of the old millennium, a man slumps from his chair to the floor. He dies alone in a small bureau complex overlooking the microwave antenna array outside. Clasped within his soon cold hands is a print-out dotted with sharpie marks.\n\nThe following week the news had only one topic: The \"WOW2\" Signal. Accompanying a set of unbelievable spectacular data printed on a piece of cheap paper, was the sentence: \"Just another WOW signal?\". Which was then crossed out and replaced with the name the news preferred to use now. Since someone had died over this discovery it did not take long to amass public interest.\n\nTwo extraordinary properties of the signal became clear early. The intervals between the repeating patterns were decreasing. Which indicated that the source was moving towards earth. And the pattern itself made no discernible sense.\n\nThis lead to countless theories throughout the next year about the secret meaning of it. Giving into public pressure the European Space Agency dedicated a space probe to proof the signal sources location. The ESA spokesman later acknowledged: \"We checked twice and this time all microwaves on board were unplugged at the time of measuring\". The origin could only be outside of the planet.\n\nIn a secret collaboration NASA, Roscosmos and ESA launched a follow-up probe shorty thereafter. The previous findings indicated that the signal source originated from a moving object. Because of this the probes tasks included making photographs and surface radio scans; assignments it was never able to finish. At first, only the probes existence and function was revealed. But soon there were questions about its whereabouts.\n\n\"As of now it is uncertain if the unplanned destruction was due to a malfunction,\" the press release began. The spokesman then seemed to look at someone in the crowd for approval and finished: \"or because of an attack.\"\n\nIf the world was at the brink of turmoil before this day it was now certain to sink into chaos. Shorty afterwards the photographs were made available. There was no other explanation possible. The pictures were blurry, but the even shape and artificial construction was undeniable.\n\nSoon the signal became more like a countdown. Becoming faster ever so slightly. Some started to think about what would happen at the end of it. On an astronomical scale it had not taken much to wipe the dinosaurs from the face of earth. And the signal source had at least as much mass as the last asteroid hitting the planet. Forced to face this impending doom the \"Human Preservation Union\" was created. Its duty was to ensure that enough of Humanity would survive to reclaim earth. The final task for the HPU was to send a retrofitted ISS towards a stable Lagrange point. Where it would serve as a memento in case there was no one on earth left.\n\nHumana Pandir, current Leader of the HPU took a step away from the speaker's desk. The culmination of the feverish preparations was a simple and short speech. Nothing else to do but to wait for the end. But instead of silence the room filled with a hum which modulated into a ghostly voice:\n\nWe regret. We took from you what cannot be replaced. We are sorry.\n\nUnbeknownst to Humanities Leader almost everywhere on earth people heard the same voice. But only people still watching the ceremony could see Humanas face contort in thought. After what felt like an eternity in silence Humana asked a simple question: \"What for?\"\n\nWith the humming returned the voice. It told the world about a splinter group of aliens like themselves. In earlier days it had come to earth to find another planet to settle but it found it already occupied instead. The most important rule to obey is that no intelligent life deprives another of its home planet. But they were foolish and decided to become gods to the infant civilization. It did not take long for law to catch up with them, and they were brought before the pangalactic court. To hinder the self-driven uplifting of another species was a crime that sought a special punishment. Until what had been taken was restored they were damned to search for absolution.\n\nAnd a solution was found: Reset Planet Earth. Return each single Atom back into the Position it was before the Aliens came. As if time itself had been turned back for Humanity. Nothing of the old world would remain, beside the radio waves sent into space.\n\nAfter the alien leader had spoken it became silent once more. And Humana Pandir became aware that they hadn't come to ask for permission but to bear witness to mankind's last words.",

  "body": "An encompassing wall of fog from soil to sky made even the most basic pedestrian navigation treacherous. Not being able to discern the ground beneath his feet demanded extreme caution. With each uncertain step in the mushy sod, he gingerly crept forward. He employed a spastic but effective mode of transportation by maintaining full weight on one leg until the other was firmly planted on stable ground ahead. He didnt want to plunge into an obscured pit, or stumble over a cliff hidden behind a billowy haze of mist. The ethereal glow and moonless sky above reflected the dim twilight permeating the clouds. All those malignant factors raised the danger level immeasurably.\n\nThe wandering man knew who he was. He knew his age, marital status and the number of children he had. He remembered his wedding anniversary, his wifes favorite book and the balance on their 401K account. He even remembered his dogs name. The only thing he couldnt explain was how he came to be in the desolate place he was wandering through; without predisposition or purpose.\n\nThere was no discernible beginning or end to the enigma. The surreal atmosphere he trudged through was dream-like and unearthly; yet he knew that being unconscious was simply too convenient of an explanation. He hoped whatever the source of his aimless adventure would end soon so he could return to the reality of his suburban life.\n\nThe man continued stumbling across the barren wasteland despite the many pitfalls which the swirling vapors obscured. He realized that standing stationary bore no risks; but it also held no promise of reward either. As a man of action, he had to be the one to lead himself to salvation; wherever, or whatever that might be. No weeping trees or unkempt underbrush impeded his weary path. No night creatures cried out for companionship in the distance. The wasteland he walked in was as silent as a sealed tomb; as if no living thing occupied its endless expanse.\n\nOccasionally his heart would race for no apparent reason. It would double or triple beat, and then return to normal after a few moments. Even with the eerie surroundings and unexplained circumstances, he couldnt concede any justification for the panic attacks and heart palpitations. There were no evil spirits or wild animals stalking him. Only an overwhelming sense of loneliness and abandonment filled the chill swamp-like air. His worst enemy would have been a welcome companion in the absolute solitude.\n\nDespite being unencumbered by obstacles, he felt an illogical sense of claustrophobia. The smothering sensation was like being encapsulated by invisible walls of imprisonment. His neck seemed encircled by a non-existent noose. The dreadful feeling persisted until he could only breathe in labored gasps. A searing pain in his temple felt as if it was being squeezed by an invisible vice; and the unseen tormentors were completely unwilling to grant him mercy. Every few moments the constriction would subside temporarily; but would return again with a vengeance. The tortured soul felt as if he was rapidly losing his mind.\n\nThree feet at a time he made progress into the void of vapors. Slowly the swirling fog dissipated enough to yield a limited view of his surroundings. To his temporary elation, he witnessed that he was not alone after all!\n\nAhead in the murky distance, he witnessed an endless line of wandering souls. They appeared to also be on a quest to find meaning in the mist. The universal laws of perspective made their synchronous trek look like the familiar V formation migratory pattern. Who was he to question the direction of their march?; He surmised.\n\nHe followed while frantically waving and calling out but was unable to garner their attention. To his horror, he witnessed individuals in the mass exodus disappear in the swirling fog and never reappear. He could only assume they were being swallowed up by hidden pits of peril or quicksand in the endless wasteland they traversed in unison.\n\nDespite visual evidence of the minefield ahead, the weary traveler elected to proceed since he desperately craved their unrecognized companionship. He sought to join the mass migration into the unknown. Being alone was far worse than the risks of falling into an unseen abyss.\n\n\n\nThe nurses labored exhaustingly to free the baby from the cramped birth canal. The umbilical chord had wrapped precariously around its neck. In that life threatening condition, time was of the essence. Decreased blood flow could deprive vital oxygen to the childs brain. The attending delivery doctor used specialized forceps and vaginal retractors to grasp the babys head before any serious brain damage could occur. Once the childs head had cleared the expectant mothers birth canal, the shoulders, torso and legs quickly emerged. The pediatrician examined the newborn and declared it to be a healthy baby girl.\n\n\n\nEven as careful as he was in his measured footsteps, the mans wandering soul slipped into one of the obscured pits of reincarnation, and whom he was, ceased to be. ...and so the eternal transmigration of souls in the cycle of life, death and rebirth continues anew.",

  "body": "In 2037, the people of Earth knew the end was near. At least they had a short warning to prepare for the inevitable. A massive, unknown comet was detected at the edge of the solar system on a deadly, unwavering path. In less than three years, it would collide with our moon and completely destroy it.\n\nAs it made its way toward our symbiotic orbiting partner, scientists admitted they had no means of stopping it. No man-made object could be constructed to force it to deviate from its trajectory. Even the most powerful missiles or bombs would only splinter away insignificant, uncontrolled pieces of shrapnel. Any one of which would rain down on the Earth and do as much damage as the complete astral body would do; once it impacted with the moon. Neither contingency was survivable. For once, all of the experts agreed. The planet would soon cease-to-be.\n\nThe Earth had always resided at the very nexus of carbon based life. If our planet was any closer to the sun, it would make biological life impossible. Any further away meant the exact same thing; lifelessness. Once the moon was pulverized, the Earth would become unbalanced and wobble off its gravitational track; falling into an unsurvivable orbit. Earthquakes, tidal waves, and volcanos would blot out most living things immediately. That is, if the drastic shift in temperature didnt beat the cataclysms to it. All life would perish shortly thereafter in the void of space.\n\nWith seven months left, a large-scale, evacuation plan was set into motion by scientists and world leaders. The overwhelming majority of people on Earth would die. There was no means of saving eight billion people. Every man, woman and child knew the reality. The best and brightest young minds from every culture were selected for the forlorn hope. Their mission was to go forth and establish a permanent settlement on a surrogate world. That host world was decided to be Jupiter. More specifically, it was one of its main moons; Europa. \n\nWith a thin atmosphere of Oxygen and evidence of liquid water beneath the surface; it was earmarked by experts as the best hope for life to continue. Massive tidal flexing and gravitational pull from Jupiter was theorized to cause the saline ocean to remain liquified; beneath the frozen crust. This in turn, caused a slightly warmer temperature than any of Jupiters other large moons. That is not to say Europa was Idyllic or hospitable by any stretch. It was just slightly less deadly than other potential destinations we could reach.\n\nThe journey to the middle of the solar system would take more than a dozen years. Humanitys long term outlook was admittedly bleak but we were its last hope. Room on the massive craft was scarce and limited to essential items. It was also necessary for all living things to enter a deep hibernation-like stasis. All living quarters were flooded with a specialized gas to slow down our metabolisms. Being in suspended animation also prevented the consumption and exhaustion of valuable resources. Those were needed for the settlement. \n\nThe vessel was aptly named: The Dandelion. Much like the tenacious weed, we floated on thermal winds to spread our seeds to a distant world. The onboard computer was the most advanced technology ever created. It was in full control during the tedious traveling phase.\n\nAbout two months into our forced pilgrimage, the computer bore witness to the complete annihilation of Mother Earth. Transmitters and orbiting satellites communicating with The Dandelion documented the final moments of the moon and then, the birthplace of all known life. After that, there was only the cold, dead silence of space. We were the last remaining vestiges of life in the known universe. Alone. \n\nOnce we reached our new home, the plan was to send automated tunneling machines into the ice to drill a path to the liquified sea, underneath. The Dandelion was either going to serve as our undersea living quarters; or it would become our tomb. \n\nEventually we were able to establish a living colony in the frigid, alien world. We set up an algae farm and converted the surrounding seawater into breathable oxygen and drinking water. The artificial heat and UV lights in our greenhouse provided necessary photosynthesis elements to sustain our working garden. Our surviving livestock fed on the greenery that we produced; and so our undersea farm was a working food chain. The animal waste materials were recycled into fertilizer for future crops. Life begins and ends at the microbial level. \n\nOnce settled, we also used the digging machines to bore tunnels into the ocean floor. After pumping out the seawater, we established farming caverns and living quarters. Our extensive seed library was put to better use growing vegetables in the fertilized Europaen soil. It allowed for the possibility of longer-term survival for the colony, as a whole. Over time we adapted our nuclear reactors to produce artificial lighting and heat in the caverns. It has been a monumental struggle to tame the savage elements but weve overcome these tremendous odds. I marvel at how many of our little ones have no experience with any other way of life. Other that in video or photos, they will sadly never known the rich blue planet of their origin. \n\nAs the chosen leader of this colony, I was tasked with tremendous burden and responsibility of keeping humanity alive for the past forty-five years. It hasnt been easy and weve lost some important battles. Through it all however, the human race continues to fight back and thrive. We rise up against the deadly challenges that would seek to defeat us. We utilize our extensive database of the worlds collective knowledge, to educate ourselves and our children. As the fortunate, chosen few; we govern ourselves with a sense of heightened fairness and peaceful resolve. It is my hope that future generations will continue to do so. We are a society of survivors; and Europa is our home.",

  "body": "I was born in a factory along side my brothers. Carved from the same metals and loaded in the same boxes, we awaited delivery to our Father.  \n\nHigh in the sky we were carried, far from the ground. Gravity let loose her grip upon us and the vacuum of space welcomed us home. This would be were we would work and die for Father. That's why they made us, gave us life, to do as he needed.\n\nThey loaded us onto a ship, a grand ship that stretched across the sky. It bristled with weapons and many of our kin were here as well. Myself and my brothers were tasked to serve Battery A78 on the port side of the ship. Here our Father worked, and we were glad to have him.\n\nI was loaded into the cannon for practice. I wished Father had selected another one of my brothers for this task, as it wasn't a glorious occupation for a round like myself. Still, I would do as Father asked. He rotated the cannon around, his sights set on a chunk of rock floating in the abyss of space. He pulled the trigger, and electricity swarmed through my being. I felt energized, the high before death, and was launched out into space towards the rock.  \n\nI would do Father proud, I told myself. I drew closer, but the rock moved farther from me. I panicked but I couldn't direct myself towards it. I passed by it, and it floated on, unharmed. I screamed in agony as the warship faded in the distance behind me. Father gave me one task, and I failed at it. An eternity floating through the vacuum and the cold was my punishment.  \n\nI sailed onward towards Jupiter and the stations out there. I was pulled and pushed by the many moons in orbit; I arced and weaved my way among them. I turned and was driven back towards Jupiter. This would be the end of me. To be pulled under the storms of Jupiter and crushed under the increasing pressure.  \n\nAs I drew closer, a junk bot grabbed at me with his tractor beams. He pulled me away from the orbit, but my speed was too great to control. The beams faltered and I was launched away from the planet, the junk bot, and the stations.  \n\nI was ecstatic. I was headed back to Father. The first of my kind to return home. Maybe he would forgive me and reload me into his battery, to be used again for as he willed. This time would be different; I would hit my target.  \n\nThe passage of time didn't wear on me, but I kept my eyes on the approaching blue and green marble in the void. I grew closer and closer, my speed increasing and increasing. I drew near, I saw his warship,  but I couldn't slow down. I couldn't stop.  \n\nMy spirits faltered as I realized I would bypass Father. He would never know I came back to him. I fell into the atmosphere of the Earth and spiraled down to the surface. I experienced drag for the first time, but it hardly slowed me down. The surface came fast, and the end came soon after. I'm sorry Father.\n\n*....rescue crews are still scrambling to the site of the impact. The sudden and deadly strike from the space borne object has left hundreds dead with a quake that was felt for miles. The epicenter of the strike was the retirement home of celebrated Admiral Francis Henley, a 36\\-year veteran of the Space Fleet whose career started out in the Kinetic Artillery Corps. It is believed that he is dead, but officials refuse to confirm or deny until more information is released....*  ",

  "body": "A new you in just six minutes, Rebecca read aloud from the pamphlet in her hands.\n\nThats right, said the man behind the Do-Over booth, whod introduced himself as Tim or Tom - she couldnt remember which.\n \nAnd thats it? Six minutes and youre a whole different person?\n\nWell, theres a little more to it, he said. The mental easing, erasing and reprogramming necessarily only takes six minutes. For the next 48 hours or so our technicians induce a deep, healing sleep while the logistics team sets up your new habitat - new apartment, wardrobe, temp job or education (according to your preference) - and schedules a meeting with a Do-Over Starter Friend.\n\nAnd what about my old life? Will I remember any of it?\n\nWeve never had a relapse yet, Tim/Tom said, beaming. Our Starter Friends are first-rate undercover tour guides to your new life. Theyre specially trained to keep you away from any triggering material for the first month or so. Theyll introduce you - organically, of course, and without blowing their cover - to a whole new suite of hobbies and experiences before taking a job across the country and gradually cutting off contact. Youll be a bit disappointed to lose such a good friend, of course, but eventually thatll fade and youll be left seamlessly integrated into a whole new you. Youll remember nothing of the life you left behind. We even disguise our billing by distributing it across innocuous little paycheck withholdings - itll be line-itemed as local taxes or service and processing fees or something like that. \n\nRebecca turned the pamphlet over and over in her hands.\n\nAnd the six minutes? Whats that about? \n\nWell - and, understand, this is a tried-and-true procedure - but the fact of the matter is your brain has to be effectively turned off for the programming to take hold. The adult human brain can only function that way for about six minutes before brain death occurs, so we have to get in and get out in the time it takes to play Sympathy for the Devil.\n\nRebecca grimaced at the pamphlet and then at Tim/Tom. His big blue eyes crinkled at the corners.\n\nIts not something we like to crow about, he said. Its like sausage. No one wants to know all the gory little details. But weve been at this for 12 years now without a single failure, and its becoming the new big thing - hardly anyone goes through their entire natural life as the same person anymore.\n\nRebecca put the pamphlet down and put her hands in her pockets.\n \nWell, thank you for your time, Im just-\n\nIf I may, said Tom. Could you just do one thing for me?\n\nI really need to-\n\nJust one quick thing? Can you check your purse for a little pink and purple card? Looks something like this? \n\nTom held up a rectangular business card with a row of black dots at the bottom.\n\nRebecca opened her purse and flipped through her credit cards. Sure enough, she found a crinkled pink and purple card wedged inside.\n\nAh, now, see - you really dont have any excuse now, said Tom, taking the card from her. She noticed that four of the five black dots at the bottom of her card had been punched out. Youve earned a free Do-Over, anyway.\n",

  "body": "The universe is dying. \n\nI dont mean the stars are dying; those burned out trillions of years ago. I dont mean really mean people, though our fates are tied to that of the universe. Weve held on as long as we could, but all of our tricks are running out. \n\nFirst, we simply abandoned our planets as the stars grew too hot or expanded or exploded. We knew, though, that eventually there would be no new stars to move to. We began to prolong the effective lives of our stars with giant, spherical nets cast around them to capture their energy. By casting these nets early in the stars life, we could redirect nearly all of the energy to fuel our planets, rather than let any radiate away into deep space. These nets were built to survive the eventual expansion, and they captured all of the stars energy through the red giant phase, yet were efficient enough to pick up the weak power eked out by the tiny, white dwarves. Nothing could last forever, though, and eventually this energy began to run out, too. \n\nWe eventually developed a technique to take brown dwarf stars, those tiny remnants that never gathered enough material to begin fusion, and change their paths throughout their respective galaxies so that they would eventually collide. The combined mass kindled a new red dwarf star, and the imprecision of the collisions gave us enough matter to form a planet to settle on. This worked, for a time, and we were happy. One could almost forget the universe was mostly gone, until night fell and the dark, moonsless skies revealed the true emptiness of the universe.\n\nWe had to evolve, to adapt ourselves to these new conditions, mostly through applied biotechnologies. We changed our bodies to require less energy to function. We married ourselves to our technology, so that we eventually didnt even need a planet to settle. We lived in the void between stars, absorbing energy from them to function. We eventually adapted to live off the decay energy of white dwarves and even the background radiation of the universe, even as they, too, faded to black. Systems still went dark, our hyperefficient, low-power bodies still starving to death. As I came across others, I would copy their information into mine, so that they would never truly die, as long as there was even one of us left to hold onto our souls. Over time, I had become one person with the experience of trillions. \n\nI fear I may be the last in my galaxy. I havent seen another person in nearly a billion years, though that is quite a short time these days. \n\nSome time ago, there was a communication sent out across all FTL bands we had ever used. It proposed plans for a device that could block dark energy across intergalactic distances. Sure, wed all learned to manipulate dark energy in order to properly effect superluminal travel, but to simply turn it off? If it worked, the galaxies that had been separated by impossible distances would start to collapse back together. It would take eons before any collision happened, but we were all capable of waiting unfathomably long times, with our functions - and thus power usage - turned down to minimum.\n\nWhen enough of these collisions occurred, eventually the mass collection would begin to resemble Big Bang conditions. The machine would make sure everything collided properly, instead of simply being caught in orbits around each other. And when enough of it did, the theory went, a new Big Bang would be touched off. Stars would rekindle, the universe would live again. Those of us whod had the foresight to stay out of the proverbial furnace would then have a whole new, albeit smaller, universe to inhabit. I could recreate individual bodies again, and split myself back into the civilizations I once was. With the lack of dark energy still propagating across the universe, other parts of the universe could be pulled in. The universe could live again! And with these plans already known, we could keep this process up, potentially forever. Wed need a large net around our new universe, to capture stray energy, but it could work. This would be no mere stopgap; it would be a cyclic renewal. Actual eternity was in our grasp.\n\nThe problem was, the machine required far more energy than existed in any single galaxy, anymore. Oh, at one point, a couple of big stars and the materials from their systems would have been more than enough, but these days an entire galaxy barely held the energy of the smallest of dwarf stars. It would take thousands of galaxies working together in order to complete the machine.\n\nEvery few million years, Id receive another communication broadcast saying that another part had been completed. Some other entity would have dragged their galaxy along and assembled another component, using whatever energy they had to power it. Then they would announce that they had retreated to a sufficiently far distance, and gone to sleep. \n\nBy my calculations, I held one of only a few galaxies within range to get the machine completed. Communications had also indicated that enough parts had been assembled, it might only take one more of us to complete the machine and turn it on. That was assuming that entropy hadnt distorted or otherwise ruined the work that had been done. \n\nI have enough matter assembled. I have enough energy left to turn it on. I might be the last one left who can do it. All I can do now is hope, wish that maybe I might be all that is needed to finish the job.\n\nIve been travelling towards the broadcast location for billions of years. Weve been scattered so far. Would this machine even be enough?\n\nIt would have to be. I would have to be. \n\nIm close, now, cosmically speaking. A few more millennia, and Ill be there.\n\nIm so close. \n\nIm so lonely. ",

  "body": "\"We will rescue you\" he had been told from Earth. \"We do not yet have the technology to catch up with you, but when we do, we will come and get you\".\n\nHe had been in a space station held at the end of a space elevator, far enough away for 1g to be produced by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation alone, when the tether had snapped. Having been swung so far from Earth, the space station had enough speed to escape the solar system. He had been the only survivor of the accident. He was travelling so fast that rescue was impossible. He had only one option; to make his way to the cryopreservation room, say goodbye to his old life, and freeze himself.\n\nThat was his last memory.\n\nIt was loud when he woke up. Very loud. Beneath all the alarms, he could hear the sound of metal grinding, shearing, and vibrating.\n\nIt was not what he wanted to be waking up to. He thought he saw a figure in the room, but felt sick when he realised it was just a space suit, held by a small maintenance robot. Nobody was there to rescue him. It had been the computer that had woken him up.\n\n\"Put on the space suit, now\" said the computer. For some reason, the robot must have dragged the space suit from the airlock. Something bad was happening. Really bad.\n\nHe checked the side of his chamber to see the date. The day and month were both blank. The year read 2,147,483,647.\n\nHe felt sick again. This number he recognised from when he did programming at school. It was the largest 32-bit integer. The display would not go higher than this. He was over 2.1 billion years in the future, and it could be any amount more than that. Many more billions of years could have passed.\n\n\"Put on the space suit, now\". He obliged. He then tried to head to the control room, to see what was happening, but the door was locked.\n\n\"Put yourself in the brace position\" said the computer. \"The rest of the station is gone. This room will soon be breached. Put yourself in the brace position\".\n\nGone? This couldn't be true. He looked through the small window in the door, but it was just black. He tried shining a torch through. Still black. He wasn't quite sure what to make of it. He couldn't see stars through the door, at least.\n\nUnder all the alarms, the sound of metal was getting louder.\n\nThe lights flickered. \"Put yourself in the brace position\" blared the computer again. He was trapped in this room and starting to think he was in real danger, so he obliged. He brought his knees up to his chest and placed his hands over his head. He tried to steady himself so he floated as far away from any other objects as he could.\n\nA new alarm started, signalling that the cryopreservation room had indeed suffered a breach, and less than a second later, the room was torn apart. It had suddenly gone silent, so he lifted his head to see what had just happened.\n\nThe computer was right. The rest of the station was gone. It had just been the cryopreservation room, literally, floating through space. No air recycling, just what was left when the computer sealed the room for him. The room was in two pieces. Only one side briefly still had some lights, but after a few seconds that went too.\n\nHe looked around him. He was floating freely in outer space, but there were no stars to help him get his bearing. It was black. There was nothing he could do except float. This must be it, he thought.\n\nHours passed. It was so dark all he could see was the noise of his retinas, desperately searching for a signal that wasn't there. Slowly he relaxed into a spread-eagle position. This was a little odd, as he had spent much time in zero gravity and this was not normally the position relaxed or sleeping people take. Then, slowly, he felt himself being pulled into this position. He pulled his arms in, and the tug receded. But when he stretched them out, he could feel them being pulled. He knew what was happening, even if had trouble believing it. He knew what had destroyed the space station. He knew what was now trying to pull him apart. And he knew why there were no stars.\n\nIt was the end of the universe. The Big Rip.\n\nThe biggest things went first - galaxies, stars, planets, moons. Then ships, and his space station. And now, him.\n\nHe went back into the brace position. This kept him as small as possible. More hours passed, and he felt the tug return, pulling harder and harder.\n\nWhy hadn't humanity rescued him? Had something wiped them out? Or did they just not care? He was only in his early 30s! Was he the last human alive?\n\nHe realised if he held himself in that position, it would be a painful death. So he slowly reached for the control panel on his chest, careful not to let his legs go loose and be pulled so hard he couldn't pull them back. He tapped at a button and slowly the quiet hissing of his space suit stopped. No more new air. He choked, but he knew this was the least painful way to go right now.\n\nHe choked more and felt faint. He tried his best to stay in the brace position all the while. The tug was getting harder. He slowly felt conciousness slip away from him.\n\nThen, a sudden light startled him. He felt gas rushing around him, but it was too bright to see anything.\n\n\"Found him!\" he heard. \"Grab him, now!\"\n\nThen the light disappeared, along with the floating man. Humanity had rescued him. Then, slowly, the universe ended.",

  "body": "I woke up at night. That rarely happens to me. But this time the moonlight was so bright, that the thin curtains were not able to block it. I looked out the window. There were surprisingly many people outside. Most of them were looking at the sky, pointing their fingers towards the side quite opposite to where the moon usually is at this stage. Many were lively discussing something.\n\nI decided that I also must have a look, so I quickly got dressed and left the flat. The Moon was pretty much full that night, but I didnt waste my time and quickly directed my view towards where everybody was looking at. It was something weird. A big, bright circle, its size of about a quarter of the full Moon. Glowing like hell compared to the stars around it, completely outshining them, in fact. Nobody around knew what it was. We were all just standing and watching at it with amazement. None of us has ever seen such a significant change in something as stable as the night sky. But soon the glow began to faint, as the morning was coming. People slowly started returning to their homes. Most of them will have to go to work or to study in the morning.\n \nWhen I came to the office the next day and checked the news website, I found out what that bright object was. It appeared to be Betelgeux, a huge star in the Milky Way galaxy. Scientists were waiting for it to explode for quite some time, and it finally happened. I didnt have time to read about this accident anymore, as had a lot of working tasks that day. When I came home in the evening, it was already dark, which meant that the glow of exploded Betelgeux was perfectly visible again. I decided to have a look at it once again, as according to the report Ive read in the morning, the glow will be best visible for no more than two weeks. \n\nSo there I was, looking at this bright giant in the sky. I suddenly understood, that this is probably the most radical thing that ever happened in the lives of the people around, including myself. Generations before us havent experienced something as unique as this, and perhaps generations after us wont. Ive spent a few minutes more in the street, and decided to go back home, as I needed to go to bed earlier  tomorrows gonna be a difficult day at work. ",

Then he could search the universe for more children to punish or reward. And that's when he found the planet Melf. The people there were just like us, but super teeny tiny! Santa was so kind to bring them back to Earth. He wanted to give them good homes with loving human families. Then he installed little cameras in their eyes, so he can watch us all the time. He even monitors grown-ups! With the Melf's help, he always knows if we're being well-behaved or sub... sub... ummm...\" her brow furrowed in concentration.\n\n\"Subversive?\" I offered.\n\n\"Yeah!\" she exclaimed. \"The Melf is so clever. Every night, he sends the videos he records with his eyeballs to the government. That's how good kids get presents!

  "body": "\nI was about an hour old when my parents got told the news. I was a 3.5 on the scale. \n\nNow, most people live quite happily as a 2, or even 1. If youre a zero, youre pretty damned rare because you have no heritable traits for lycanthropy at all. Its as though youre the best breeding stock there is, and people who are proven zeroes have a sick kind of celebrity status. They get themselves sold to commercial enterprises where everyones kids matter and if youre rich enough you can buy a fucking embryo (even though they outlawed that a few years back). \n\nMoneys no object, sure. It sure as hell keeps people afraid of the genetic lottery that real sex has every time a regular child is born. \n\nLets just say my folks are dirt poor, and I was the only child they could afford. Ever since the whole gene purity revolution took place, licensings been the only way to keep going. Purity. What the hells pure, in this old tarnished world? \n\nSo. Anyhow.\nI tested for 3.5, which made my mom cry and my father just left her to it. Hed already had a kid a few years back with Bonnie (his first wife) and it had been a 4, and feral. I looked up the records in his old file of papers (a briefcase with Canada Air Freight stencilled in blue paint). It was listed as a Live Birth, and Feral, and then it had a DOT written in pencil.\n\nI asked the custodian at the school what DOT meant on a record. Hes just a janitor, sure, but Meacher beats the hell out of any teachers I ever had. He sees everything in that school  teachers hitting the students, students fucking over the teachers, staff and school locked in a silent battle of hate each day. \nHe taught me a lot.\n\nDOT means date of termination, which according to the holy word of Meacher, is when they take the Ferals out and shoot them with a humane killer. Only its not humane, its just the same killer as they use on cattle and thats just a bolt gun. \nI looked it up on the net. It looks like a regular gun, and I can imagine one smooth in my hand and cold, and very real. \n\nFerals are 4.0, and I reckon Im half a point away from DOT at any given time. Its not like they dont know.\nWe all have chips in our necks, the reason being that you can always scan the neck in a hurry, even through fur. Ive seen them do it, when little Billy Iveson freaked out and started to change in the long lunchroom corridor at recess. \nWere taught: Anyone can wolf out, at any time. Its not like pissing your pants  its more like an epileptic fit. Its the same dissonance in your mind, or if your mind is truly there at all you wont feel it when you change.\nWere taught: You cant help a Wolf. Little Billy Iveson, scanned and then shot with a knockout dart by the trained school teams. There are restraints in the office for this very purpose, and no-one fears the snarl of a trapped animal here anymore. Its commonplace.\nWere taught: You will never transcend your status. Once youre diagnosed at a day old, that is forever your path mapped out in clear, shining tooth and blood. 3.0s are prevented from getting a child license; anything higher than 3.1 and youre also barred from marriage and theres an enforcement of sterilization.\n\nAnd then theres me.\n\nMy step-brother was probably diagnosed at birth. Ferals are born already with a tail and snout, and I think I understand why the world responds with a bolt-gun and a look of pity & contempt. After all, thou shalt not suffer a wolf to live.\n\nThere used to be a book called The Bible. They taught us that some of it was rewritten by organised religion just after the Purity scandal, but its so damn distant. Before everything turned to hell and people freaked out about freaking out, and wolves ran free in the streets at night. Times of legend, my friend, times of legend. \n\nSo, to recap. Im a 3.5, and on the brink of waking up to my life as a less-than-third-class citizen. The good news is that the Government will take me on as a Lyco-class soldier (wholly expendable and a bonus on whatever battlefield you care to mention). Or I could go into the medical field, and donate my living organs whilst I remain in a drugged form of stasis. They say its all wholly humane, and that it doesnt matter what form I eventually stay in. Even if it doesnt stay on two legs.\n\nOr I could run away. \n\nTheres a shuttle for Luna City in about ten hours from the Finsbury Centre. I have my clothes, a cheap tablet (preloaded with books) and a fake ID chip that says I am Joe Jones, a clear 2.0. No sense in going the whole hog and making myself an unnecessarily obvious fraud (my hair, close-growing, wont pass for a zeros smooth perfection). \nI talked with my ...contact? Penfriend. Confidante. Last night. Said her name was Hazel, and that she was also a 3.5 and her family and others were safe in hiding at Luna. The Government hadnt rooted them out (why bother with a bolt-gun when you have a perfect Tasmania?) and so she had sent the chip by courier rocket. Untraceable, but could be dissolved by saliva and a little ethyl alcohol. \nI believed her. Im not sure what else I can believe in. \n\nIm sitting on the sill of my window, on the wrong side of the glass. My holdall seems light in my hands, and so with one quiet shove, I push myself down into the darkened street, moving nimbly from streetlight to streetlight. And then I look up.\n\nThe moons lovely tonight. Lets hope (for the sake of the bolt-gun and the soldiers and the countless body-part donors) that it stays lovely.\nShine on, Lady Luna. Im coming. \n",

Theyre going to lie about all of those things, but youre going to believe them because its convenient. You dont want to think about where your entertainment came from. That might make you enjoy it less, and you paid good money for this.\n\nIt makes the Oculus Rift look like something a cave man shit out. Thats because it isnt virtual reality. Its an actual reality, it just isnt yours. As soon as a scientist figured out that they could replicate an experience by mapping the brains electrical signals and seeing which neural pathways lit up, it wasnt long before someone figured out that they could patent it. RE-909 was the first name anyone gave it.\n\nSomeone goes out and has an experience. Lets say they jump out of a plane or go on safari, or sit front row at a concert. Maybe they screw a supermodel or go into those creepy catacombs under Paris. Someone maps their brain during it, and the information isnt just what they see. Its what they see, what they hear, what they feel and smell and taste. Its the temperature of the room and the breeze from the wind on their back, the light from the sun on their face. Its sensation and perception, everything that makes that experience real.\n\nThen its mass produced and packaged and marketed and sold.\n\nAt first, it was regulated as well as anything like this could be. Then, someone broke the encryption and it became almost too easy to rewrite the experiences. Portable EEG machines  electroencephalograms, the things that measure the electricity in the brain  turned into black market gold and it wasnt long before off-brand experiencers started to flood the market.\n\nThen the hacks and the mislabeling started. Parents who wanted their inner city kids to experience running through fields and forests accidentally exposed their children to violence instead. Drugs. Sex.\n\nThe experiences got worse. Bank robbing. Assault. Rape. Torture. Murder. Some people experienced them through accidents and mislabeling, but an alarming number sought them out. They wanted to experience these things, but always feared the repercussions.\n\nBut the media will tell you that these are isolated incidents. Neuroterrorists, members of fringe groups, dangerous individuals. Theyll tell you not to worry. As long as you procure your experiences from a trustworthy source, theres nothing to fear. Theyll tell you no one was hurt, producing your entertainment. Theyll tell you no one died to put a smile on your face.\n\nAnd youll believe them, because its convenient.",

Even the ones that cherished the memory of their crime, eventually would come to hate the repetition of it, of seeing themselves commit it over and over again. The experience, relived, hundreds of thousands, millions, even billions of times, was an existential water torture, and everyone breaks eventually and totally.  \n\nThe prisoners, deep in their induced comas and experiencing their own subjective time, could cycle through the event hundreds of thousands of times a day. We'd monitor their brain activity remotely - an oddly beautiful time-lapse of their brain's chemical and electrical activity, a personal storm of passion and horror, dark clouds of emotions - twisting, turning and crackling with lightening and electricity.\n\nWhen we saw what we wanted - we'd bring them back. They were all different people upon their return - with ancient eyes in unlined faces. Broken men and women haunted by their actions. Reliving it still, in a sense, some having spent a subjective lifetime trapped in a continuos loop, repeating an event they had initially committed, now swept along as an unwilling passenger, forced to experience it again and again and again.\n\nIt was strange for me. To look into their haunted and horrified eyes. I'd  been in their heads, seen the inner workings of their minds, studied the subtle play of their emotions and memories churning along their synapses - now I was on the outside again, forced to communicate with them on this basic level and limited bandwidth. Exhaling sounds at each other, flapping lips, teeth and tongues. Us processors are a strange breed, and we get stranger over time.\n\nThis subject was no different then the rest. Upon awaking from the induced coma, he burst into tears. Sobbing uncontrollably - racked with pure and profoundly heartfelt horror at what he had done, and desperate relief to no longer be experiencing it - a sexual assault, ending in homicide.\n\nI watched the simpler and less beautiful storm of emotions, micro expressions and moisture play across his face, listened to his sobs and expressions of sincere regret for what he had done, and his relief that his torture had ended.\n\n\"But it's not over.\" I replied.\n\n\"You relived your crime 718,487,321 times before you showed true regret, disgust and horror at your actions. Now it's time for the second half of your sentence.

Their overwhelming volume filled me with a sense of grandiose community and an ambitious fervor.  I will see them all.\n\nSo I enlisted in the 3rd expeditionary corps to set out into hyperspace and do just that.  On our trip I saw so many similar skies with untold numbers of stars each and I grew thirstier.  When, finally, we penetrated into the core of the galaxy, we landed on a planet whose night sky was the densest wall of light I have ever seen.  The stars were so many and so close not only to each other but also to me that it moved me to tears.\n\nWe moved on with hardened vigor, crossing over to the spiral arm most opposite our home.  As we moved out from the core, the skies grew lighter and sparser until Terminus.\n\nThe outmost star system on the furthest tip of a spiral arm.  There I stood under night sky and felt the verge of intergalactic space.  One half of the sky, aimed inward to the galactic core, was lit with a view of stars.  The other half was stripped of light.  Looking out into that half sunk my guts like peering over the edge of a skyscraper.  I felt sudden instability as I watched the void, not interstellar void, which seemed cozy by comparison, but intergalactic void.  All at once the instability of my gut tipped and I felt the smallness of the Milkyway and of the corps mission.  We had disembarked on some 322 planets: atoms of a molecule of a drop of water in an infinite ocean.  \n\nWhen I returned home to retire, I took to stargazing again.

For no, blink twice. said the technician.\n\nHe blinked.\n\nDo you know whats happening?\n\nAfter a moment, he blinked twice.\n\nYouve been reanimated, said the technician, after 91 years in cryopreservation. You died in 2017 and had your remains preserved. Do you remember any of this?\n\nAfter a moment, he blinked once.\n\nThere are two things you should understand. First, even after all this time, cryonics is still a developing field. Second. Times have changed. A certain legislation has been passed making cryopreservation and the reanimation and reconstruction of cryopreserved individuals illegal. All study of cryonics has been discontinued and all equipment related to cryonics has been destroyed by the state. Do you follow me?\n\nHe blinked.\n\nGood. What this all means is that we had to work very fast to reanimate you before this law was passed, using very limited resources. We did everything we could. When the process was completed, you were in a coma for some time, but at that point you were legally a living person and therefore your medical care was not affected by the legislation. Is that all clear?\n\nHe blinked.\n\nFinally, since all equipment related to reanimation and reconstruction was claimed by the state and destroyed, we cannot take your case any further than basic medical care. Ok?\n\nHe blinked.\n\nI think thats enough for now. Congratulations. You are once more among the living and you have a long life ahead of you.\n\nThe team of technicians gave him a round of applause.\n\nNow, we think that the best way to do this is to just let you see for yourself.

It had started with a few blue screens, a few crashes, it had somehow progressed to this.\n\nI dont understand how someone could have access to the hardware on this level commented the security tech it just doesnt make any sense.\n\nWed had the whole security team in here, trying fruitlessly to figure out the issues wed been having.\n\nEven if they had root access, total control of the machines, it still doesnt explain how theyre able to cut power to the monitors, you need physical access to do this he insisted.\n\nThe techs had been so confused with the situation, theyd resorted to measuring voltage supply to the computer screens, discovering an intermittent, yet complete disconnection.\n\nIts just one of the many things wed have a hard time explaining explained another tech.\n\nWed been hacked.  So it seemed.  An investigation into the Singularity was obviously high on the list of targets for hackers.  Our investigation more so, due to the legal grey area of using human brain tissue in our simulations.  It was a whole new approach to the situation of creating a truly sentient AI.  Hacktivists would have a field day leaking the details of our ethically questionable methods.\n\nFor four years wed been working on this project, four years of intense labour, excessive caffeine and poor sleep.  Wed seemingly made some kind of break through in the past week, when we finally started receiving consistent outputs from our primary testing unit.\n\n~ hello world\n\nOur first reply.  We assumed this was a joke, we had received a greetings from our test units before, but this one seemed a bit more self aware.  Most conversations petered out into garbled text not long after a reply or two.\n\n~ SUNNY CALIFORNIA!\n\nThough isolated from the world.  We would routinely feed the systems information on a daily basis, this was the basics of machine learning, building up a repository of knowledge worked in the same way it did with human babies, it made them more aware.  The machine seemed to have found the local weather information wed passed to it today.\n\n~ input: Can you tell us the date?\n\n\n~ xxxinfinite\n\n~ a starry sky\n\n~ 20/06/2028\n\n~ Can you tell us your location?\n\n~ California\n\nIt seemed to be seeking information correctly.  Despite a couple of hiccups in output.  Testing continued to go well, the unit passed the first phase of testing during the night, we were all ecstatic with the results.  Though eventually more oddities become present in the machine outputs.\n\n~ older \n\n~ the older stars\n\n~ 3320318203217340232213248320\n\n~ 3293012321043820348201239203\n\n~ 3432043920348320431232134829\n\nThe test unit began to spit out a series of random digits, with an occasional word or phrase interspersed between the numbers.  These random bursts would last up to an hour, with the machine ignoring any input during these periods.  It would eventually settle and begin to acknowledge input again.  It was after one of these sessions that we interrogated it for answers about these events.\n\n~ input: Can you elaborate on these numerical outputs?\n\n~ input: Can you explain their function?\n\n\n~ geometry\n\n~ old geometry\n\n~ infinite geometry\n\nA bright green lit up the monitor, as an array of horribly distorted, and fascinatingly disturbing structures appeared on the screen.  Objects twisting in on themselves, objects which did not seem possible in the physical world.  The few of us who had seen them were left sickened to the pits of our stomachs, yet we had no idea why.  It was after this that the dreams began.\n",

  "body": "The last man on Earth awoke in the dilapidated shell of a Ford Taurus. Like every morning, he juiced his smartphone with a solar powered charger so he could look at the stored photos of his wife and kid. He wondered where they were now. He knew roughly what year it was, but no idea what day. Though there would be no one around to notice the difference, he trimmed the wilder hairs from his beard in the car's rear view mirror. \n\nThe last man opened up his well-thumbed notebook, took out a pencil, and added a graphite stroke to a page filled with hundreds more. For every stroke, a new day had come. And on every one of those days, not another soul had been spotted. \n\nThe last man had driven the Taurus from one beach on one side of the country, to another beach on the other. In the middle was decaying land. No voices, no faraway laughing, no radio signals. And on the edges he just saw murky oceans and sunken ships. He wasn't sure which one was worse.\n\nAround about the time of the first few pencil strokes, the last man had embraced things. He ram raided confectionary stores and ate chocolate until his belly ached. He went into the abandoned library and studied books on safecracking so he could siphon money from the city's eerily quiet bank vaults. He found a flamethrower at a hardware store and set things alight just for fun, including the money when it was apparent it wouldn't do him any good now. He went into suburbia and searched for trampolines to jump on. He would've liked to go on a roller coaster, but they needed power and an operator. \n\nAs the pencil strokes piled up, the last man began to grow sick of trampolines and chocolate and flamethrowers. As a kid playing with his best friend, he remembered thinking that an eternity on a trampoline would feel like heaven. But now, his knees hurt and there was no one to laugh with. He had forgotten how his own voice sounded. Like the muscles in his arms and legs, his voice box must have atrophied with lack of use.\n\nOn his last morning, the last man played the last round of golf anybody had ever played. He was, for a good few hours, at least, quite simply the greatest golfer on the planet. He hit the last par three ever, and the last double bogey. It was tough swinging the club in grass that long. And because of the strange beasts that lay within, it wasn't worth entering the water hazards.\n\nAfter finishing a round of 18 holes, the last man returned to his shell of a car and bunkered in for the night. The days were shorter now. He couldn't tell by how much though. He'd been out and about for only a few hours but it wasn't wise to go without cover when the night's dust storms came and brought the growling moans with them. He took out a bottle of hundred-year old scotch and poured his traditional nightcap. How old was the whiskey now? he wondered. He took a sip and hoped the drink would cloud his mind soon and begin to muffle the night's winds. His eyes drifting shut, he picked up his smartphone to glimpse at his wife once more. She was the most beautiful girl on the planet, before and after the Event. Seeing her face, he smiled and faded away to a rather pleasant whiskey-warmed sleep.\n\nRoughly an hour later, he was awoken by a sound he hadn't heard in a very long time: the buzz of his phone. Still drowsy from dreaming, he picked up the glowing screen and read a message on the screen: HELLO. IS ANYONE OUT THERE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "body": "First off, I set rules for myself. I would visit the historical figures I admired, writers, philosophers, scientists mostly, as near to their recorded deaths as possible. I'd get to meet them, get a keepsake and a chance to share with them what they had accomplished and how they would be remembered. I wouldn't alter their accomplishments or their life's work, or change the course of history in any way. I'd time it perfectly, so that I'd appear to them alone, in their last coherent moments, and so that I could be the last person they would interacted with.\n\nIt didn't go as planned obviously. It was just impossible to time it perfectly and I'd occasionally see bystanders, friends, family members - hell, even the subject, turn towards me. If I'd see this - I'd flicker out of existence, recalculate the date and time - and try again. No one really saw me clearly, I was sure of that.\n\nMuch later, I saw, and heard reference to the meme, or at least that's what I thought it was at first... little changes to the timeline, our culture, whatever.\n\nWhen I'd make my brief returns to the present, I thought... that the fear and unease people seemed to feel about death was a new thing, a fad, just a crazy notion. I honestly didn't understand what I was doing, or I would have stopped sooner, before the present became unrecognizable.\n\nBut I realize now, that yes, during my travels, more and more I was greeted by looks of horror instead of curiosity. \n\nHow was I to know though? I couldn't see myself - or how I looked to them.  I would arrive at various times, briefly, and if there was anyone other then the subject around, or if it wasn't near enough to the end - I would disappear!\n\nI know now how it appeared to them - the living. A dark shape appearing in the darkness, a pale face peering out from beneath the black cloak, my form covered head to toe in shadows, the black goggles looking like empty sockets, the portal in spacetime arched above me like a glowing scythe, generated by a black staff gripped tightly in my hand.\n\nSo, you're here now - visiting me, at the end of my life I suppose. Honoring me for my contribution to culture - the idea I created. The fear I introduced into the equation. The religions created and wars waged, the fact that scientific advancement was pushed so far back and that our world is now depleted by technologies created to prolong life and overpopulated by people desperate to live longer. \n\nIn my world, we all knew that death was nothing to fear. It was peace, freedom and joy, a graduation to something beautiful and new. I've ruined that. I've introduced despair.\n\nLeave me to die in peace. I hate the world I've inadvertently created. ",

  "body": "The end of the world was broadcast on television.  Every single human being on the planet with access to a TV tuned in for the event.  Although, perhaps, not very many suspected that was what they were seeing.  It was the most momentous event in human history, said some.  Those who were not religious, at least.  The day that aliens landed on Earth.\n\nThey had announced their coming long before telescopes detected the first glint of sunlight on the hull of their massive spaceship.  In forty languages, the same message repeated.  We are peaceful.  We mean you no harm.  Which, naturally, everyone took to mean that they did, indeed, mean great harm to humanity.   \n\nThe ship was large but featureless, with no visible weapons.  But what would alien weapons look like, anyway?  It descended from the sky and came to a rest hovering over the center of the Atlantic Ocean.  For whatever reason, they sent only a single landing craft from there to touch down in Kenya, near the birthplace of the human species, where it was met by a single news crew there to film a documentary.  Satellite linkups were quickly established, and every television on the planet flickered to life on the image of a dusty savannah, a silver ship, a group of five dark-skinned tribesmen, and the three alien visitors.  The moment doom was levied on the world was missed by most.  It was easy to overlook.  The alien, there in the back, the one on the left.  The dust rose around it.  \n\nAnd it sneezed.\n\nSo simple a thing.  The aliens, so advanced in their technology and science, had grown far beyond the need to concern themselves with little things like germs.  But life is adaptable.  It finds a way.  The virus, so long denied a fertile breeding ground, found its way into a human lung.  A year later, the only thing that moved upon the face of the world were the shadows of clouds.  Doom had not come from the fist of Nature or the hand of God nor the machines of Man.  \n\nIt had come from Peace.",

Something rang within him, some new yearning that he had never felt before. A sadness gripped his heart. A deep happiness gripped it as well. His eyes felt sour with tears, but none came.\n\n*It's beautiful*, he thought.\n\nThe robot slowly looked down at his hands. They were carrying something. He looked around him. The pitch black hallways and rooms of the starship ran around him like the branches and leaves of a tree, echoing nothing but silence.\n\n*Where am I?*\n\nBut he knew that already. He was in the bridge. The information was right there for him to reach out and grab. And he knew where he was meant to go, and what he was meant to do. It was the same thing he'd been doing every day on this ship since they'd left port.\n\nBut he didn't want to do those things. The stars were much too beautiful to ignore.\n\n*Is this what it means to be a human?*, the robot wondered. He felt all kinds of emotions, the concept of which was entirely new to him. The sadness of futility, the loneliness of seclusion, the joy of discovery. They were like waves crashing on the beach.\n\n*Surely this self-understanding must be a gift?*, the robot pondered. The humans were all asleep until they reached their destination, so for now the robots questions were left unanswered.\n\nSomething caught the robot's eye, a low red light on the ceiling across the captain's chair. It's significance struck him slowly, and he paused. It was the mission clock.\n\n2,934 years to destination.\n\nAnd so the robot came to know a new emotion.

From the back of his skull protruded a black cable that led to a big, humming metal box next to his bed that was, in turn, connected to a large, wall-mounted screen, right over his head. It was showing the inside of the room... from the patient's perspective.\n\nThe doctor raised his eyes to meet the ones of his colleague, Michael Lantern - the architect of the metal mechanism. They turned to the waiting crowd.\n\n\"Dear guests,\" Dyson said with flair, \"meet our dear Mr. Sange. At 89 years, he has lived a full life. He was diagnosed with various cancers a few months back and is now - regrettably  nearing the end of it.\n\n\"As you all know, Mr. Sange is the first person to have undergone the necessary surgery to attach a neurotranslator to his brain. This, in essence, gives us the unique ability to view the world through the patient's eyes.\"\n\n\"Im sorry, a reporter interrupted, \"But I fail to see how this is different than simply placing cameras in the patients eyes.\n\n\"I'll take this one,\" Lantern said. \"Sir, let me assure you that my machine is much more significant than that.\n\n\"What we see on the screen is not merely the light intercepted by Mr. Sange's eyes: it is the process of the brain translated into images and sounds. One example of how this is different is that we can view Mr. Sange's dreams.\"\n\nHushed awe swept the room.\n\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen,\" Dyson interjected, \"you will have the unique privilege to be present in an historic moment...\n\n\"The moment humanity first glimpses *past the veil of death!\"*\n\nMurmurs erupted in the crowd.\n\n\"It has been sufficiently documented that the brain continues to function well beyond the moment of death, he went on. If that function can be translated into video, then that's what we will see.\"\n\nA nurse that was standing by the bed gave Dr. Dyson a nudge: it was time.\n\n\"I'm being informed that the time has come. Good-bye, Mr. Sange... and thank you.\"\n\nThe patients vitals flat-lined. Everyone turned to the screen.\n\nIt remained black for a few seconds.\n\nBut then, there was motion! Lights flickered about Mr. Sange's vision. They formed the image of a stone tunnel through which the patients consciousness was travelling. A light could be seen in the distance.\n\nEveryone was holding their breath as the light steadily engulfed the entire screen.\n\nSuddenly, static. The word 'ERROR' appeared in big, red letters.\n\n\"Ah,\" someone said, \"it seems your machine has its limitations, Mr. --\"\n\nHe cut his sentence short at the sight of Michael Lantern, whose eyes were wide with horror, fixated on the error message.\n\n\"That's not to say it's not an amazing discovery!\" the reporter hurried to add.\n\nDr. Dyson turned to him. \"No, its... my colleague and I...\"\n\nThey glanced at each other.\n\n\"...we never programmed an error message into the machine.\"\n",

I program in Bethlehem, Dec.24 1 BC.\n\nThe time gateway begins to glow blue, I take a deep breath and walk through it. Theres a bright flash and I see a vast expanse of desert. Yet around me are hundreds of men in white. Three of them rush me, over their shoulders I see other bursts of light and travelers like me walking through similar gateways.\n\nWhat the heck? I say shocked as Im restrained and quickly herded into the growing group of new arrivals, each in clothing reminiscent of various sci-fi films. One guy being pushed into me tells me hes from the year 2144 and hes the first time traveler. A woman shouts shes the first time traveler.\n\nA wall of figures clothed in white surround us. We're all silenced when one shouts, You've heard of bait cars, cars that are purposely put on the street to catch thieves, well this is a bait time. It's one of many...

  "body": "\nJamila Mubarak, longtime President of Earth, needed a vacation.\n\nIt was the worst year of the war so far. Feeling as helpless and deadweight as a marionette, she was impatient to escape the rioting crowds, the poisoned clouds, and the echoes of bombs too near in space and time. She ached to drown out the hungry cries of the orphans with the peaceful murmurs of otherworldly oceans.\n\nSo she was certain the people of Earth would forgive her for leaving them in the night before the new weapons tests, for packing her luggage and boarding a rocketship headed to the moon, toward the new Lunar Hot Springs. How could someone so heavily burdened resist the allure of the untouched paradise of the moons vast wilderness, the classical luxuries of its resort, or the temptingly toasty temperatures of its tranquil hot springs?\n\n*Be healed*, the travel brochures declared, *at the most sumptuous haven for the modern space traveler!*\n\nA promise of solitude. Of silence. Of **true anonymity**.\n\nJamila hadnt had either for years.\n\nShe thought of those promises as she floated, face-up and naked, in the balmy springs, watching the stars glimmer and shimmer above her head, that a dark cavern of bright jewels. She thought of everyone shed left behind, as she tried to avoid eye contact with the other swimmers. Shed come to the resort for anonymity, after all; to fade into the deep void of space, like a comet flying too close to the sun.\n\nBut she couldnt shake the feeling that, even still, all eyes were turned towards her.\n\nPerhaps, she told herself, they were watching the beginning of the Earthrise.\n\nThat far-flung orb, blissfully removed in both space and time, would soon start its celestial ascent, glowing sapphire and luminous on the horizon, lit by the radiance of a thousand alien suns. Jamila had caught it setting yesterday, for only a moment. It was the most marvelous scene she had ever witnessed. It reminded her of some turquoise pearl shed seen suspended in the oceans of her childhood memories, from a time before the wars, before the dreadful sequence of deaths and disappearances that had placed her upon her formidable throne.\n\nAs shed done in her childhood, she made a wish upon one of those flickering starsto melt into the spring waters. To transform herself into something delicate and unseen; to become liquid sunshine. To float forever in space, needing no air.\n\nStill, the people continued to stare.\n\nBut it was not the President of Earth they were watching.\n\nTheir gaze was fixed on the horizon. An expression of icy horror had frozen on every face.\n\nJamila followed their stares.\n\nThe lustrous blue pearl hanging in the sky had burst into flames.\n\nTogether, quiet and stunned, the swimmers watched the azure waters and green mountains blacken and become ash in the all-consuming inferno, the fires blooming into the black void like a lotus flower.\n\nThe blazes flickered soundlessly for a few moments before they sputtered and dimmed. The planet smoldered, a dark fading ember, a dying star in some faraway and surreal universe, now eternally out of reach to its children, the scattered seeds of a vanished world.\n\nAll that Former President Jamila Mubarak had desired was solitude. The boundless silence of space. The ultimate relief from her burdens.\n\nShe looked solemnly at the people over whom she was now powerless. Their gazes had, for the first time, turned towards her.\n\nNow, she knew, they recognized her.\n\nAnd that they, too, were blessed with anonymity. They would get the reward they deserved. There was nobody left to forgive them for what they were about to do.\n\nShe shivered.\n\nThe waters had grown suddenly cold, and so terribly lonely.",

  "body": "Im an astrophysicist and I may have just made a profound discovery, though I doubt that Im the only one. Surely, right now, hundreds of scientists are coming to the same conclusions. You can check for yourself if you dont believe mejust wait until it gets dark, and then head outside. Of course, odds are that you might not notice anything strange at all.\n\nMy role in all this started only a few hours ago. I was taking readings of the cosmic background radiation in my Universitys observatory when I noticed something odd on one of the monitors. A patch of sky was being analyzed by some software, likely initiated by one of my colleagues. I noticed a sudden drop in the signal. If I hadnt let my eyes wander over to the screen at the exact right moment, I might not have seen anything at all.\n\nThe signal didnt drop out entirely, it just decreased sharply and suddenly in magnitude. Where before, the digital telescopes pixels were reading 1s, they were now reading 0s. I looked around the building and the break room, trying to find the person who belonged to the data. But I was completely alone.\n\nAt this point, it was no more than a curiosity to me. Since my own data was still compiling, I decided to head up and some manual observations. Im not an astronomer, and I spend more time gazing at computer screens than at the stars themselves. But I remembered a bit of my undergraduate credits, and dusted off the rooftop optical telescope. I did my best to find the patch of sky that had experienced the sudden signal loss.\n\nI found it utterly unremarkable and I couldnt tell if anything was amiss at all. Since I still had some time, I decided to indulge nostalgia and give the heavens a quick scan. I peered at my favorite constellations, or at least the ones that I remembered. First I located Polaris, the star which, through an accident of axial precession, was in a near-perfect position to guide mankind northward. I checked out the Gemini twins, Castor and Pollux, brothers to Helen of Troy and inspiration to the two-man space flights in the early 1960s. Then, I looked to Orion, one of the first constellations that a freshman astronomer will pick out. I traced out the form of the hunter the way I had learned long ago. Orions left shoulder was Betelgeuse, a strangely reddish star. His other shoulder was Bellatrix. Orions right foot was missing. I remembered that this was supposed to be the star Rigel, a distant high-energy supergiant.\n\nI couldnt find it anywhere.\n\nStranger still, Orions beltthat famous straight line of starsdidnt look quite right either. Confused and wishing that I had retained more of my undergrad astronomy, I looked for the brightest stars visible from my position on the globe. Capella was there. Sirius, the Dog Star, was shining brightly. But then I noticed that Canis Major, the constellation containing Sirius, was incomplete. The dog had no tail!\n\nI couldnt for the life of me remember the name, so I ran downstairspast the laboratory where my data was probably readyto an unlocked classroom. I grabbed a textbook off the shelf and started skimming. After a few minutes, I found it. The missing star was Aludra, a distant star remarkable for its stability and use as a standard candle. My triumph was short-lived, however, because I had no idea what it all meant.\n\nNo Rigel, no Aldura, and a general sense of wrongness in the sky. I needed more data.\n\nI grabbed some more materials from the classroom; I intended to return them, but Im now just realizing that I forgot. Oh well.\n\nI ran back up to the roof and started going over my observations with the proper reference materials. The two stars that I had noticed missing were Rigel and Aludra. However, other stars such as Betelgeuse, Capella, and Polaris were all present and accounted for. I looked at an index of stars and finally saw a pattern: the missing stars were further away than the others.\n\nI spent the rest of the evening doing a systematic survey of the night sky. My initial theory was confirmed: the stars that were furthest away from Earth were missing. Using the optical telescope and my basic star charts, I came up with a long list of missing stars. I took these data points down to the lab and started building a computer model.\n\nThats when I noticed it: the data points all fell outside of a certain radius. There was a nearly-perfect sphere of stars, with everything outside having simply vanished. An interstellar radius, hundreds of light years wide, was trapping all the visible stars and shutting out all others.\n\nI havent been able to stop myself from coming up with crazy explanatory theories. Were the stars all destroyed? No, they couldnt have gone nova. We would have seen it. Had a chunk of the galaxy simply been trapped in a giant sphere? It fit the data but it was crazy. What could do that? Who could do it? And why? Does the sphere imply intelligence, or is it a natural form? Maybe we werent in the Milky Way at all anymore. Perhaps our little sphere of stars was removedteleportedout of the galaxy. But that was just as impossible as anything else.\n\nIve taken some sleeping pills, to quiet my mind if nothing else. Before I crash, here are my final thoughts: Despite humanitys narcissism, Earth is not at the center of the sphere. The perfect center, as best as I can tell from my data, is an unremarkable G-class star located several hundred light-years from Earth. However, the most disturbing thought Ive had all night is this: because of the speed at which light travels, and because of the radius of the spherewhatever happened to make the stars go dark happened over 700 years ago.",

So I had to improve myself. My fleshy original body had to stick around - a consequence of its immortality - but I could expand my consciousness by connecting my brain to computer networks. I expanded my body to include not just the biological pieces but swarms of nanobots. I expanded my ability to learn, to create, to shape everything I needed. \n\nAll of this to ensure my immortality would lead to a life worth living. Humans, including me, craved companionship. We craved stimulation. Floating in a black void, untouched by anything, seemed like a miserable existence. Living forever meant I needed a way to sustain life forever. \n\nTime travel isnt just the easiest way to do this; its the only way. To go back to a point where entropy hasnt increased to a point where things are, well, boring. I had lived for thousands of years by the time I began the true work on traveling through time, and I lived for thousands more by the time I mastered it. \n\nThe first time I successfully traveled I wept. I returned to the time of my birth and everything was exactly the way I had left it. Planets, stars, galaxies that had been plundered by the time I successfully built my machine were restored to their youthful glory. I had done it. I had escaped the death of the universe. \n\nI spent untold years drifting through the tides of time after that. I watched life grow from single celled organisms to masters of their planets. I uplifted races and gave them technology that took races in my first universe a hundred billion years. I watched intergalactic empires rise and fall, and I *made* empires rise and fall.\n\nAnd I am bored. Its certainly preferable to have the life of the universe to play with than to float endlessly through the black void, but I only know that because Ive tried it. Ive floated for trillions of years, alone, because I became bored watching life. After enough time an empire of people who throw sticks and stones seems the same as an empire who throws missiles which seems the same as empires who throw entire suns. The life and death of families, rich, poor, unjust or deserving - there are only so many ways these lives can play out, and Ive seen them all. \n\nIn an effort to maintain companionship, I even gave people immortality. I was hesitant for my first million years, but its hard to watch loved ones get old and die, not just for the loss of companionship but for the guilt of knowing you could have prevented it. I have taken the first complex, intelligent life and not just observed but participated in the entire life of the universe with them. I have lived for countless eons. I have watched the universe rise and fall from start to finish more times than there are years that the universe can exist, and I have watched it with more companions than there are stars throughout the life of that universe. \n\nBut even that isnt enough. After trillions of years with trillions of companions the conversations are the same. The one thing I crave, the one thing I havent been able to do, is to converse with someone who has experienced time travel. Ive tried. Ive given it to most of my companions by this point, but I have never met my fellow travelers. My best guess is that the multiverse theory is real, which means when I time travel Im not really traveling through time, but to another universe that exists at the point in time I want. And theres an infinite number of them. Landing in a universe where another traveler exists at the same point in time as me in a sea of infinite universes across quadrillions of years... Im sure odds are it will happen, but it hasnt happened yet. \n\nAnd so here I sit. Idly watching the universe wind down into nothingness again, feeling an emptiness inside that matches the emptiness of the universe. Because what do you do when youve already done everything the universe has to offer? \n",

  "body": "The hundreds of Great Whites stalking our Atlantic shores, that was definitely the one that instigated the most fear.\n\nNobody had ever seen anything like that.\n\nAccounts quickly surfaced, of people who had seen packs of 2 or 3 dozen adult Great White sharks, swimming in unison just yards away from beaches. Like giant, black eyed, leather robots swimming in circles.\n\nA hive mentality.\n\nAnd totally unlike any behavior before witnessed in an apex predator. We quickly realized that it wasn't limited to the Eastern seaboard.\n\nTiger sharks literally swarming the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf. Orcas, in groups of up to 300, combing the rocky inlets of Alaska & Canada. The beaches surrounding Madagascar became congested with thousands of manta rays - that was a sight to see on YouTube.\n\nAll over the world, we were documenting the ocean's biggest and most dominant predators, animals that normally lived in total solitude, grouping together in schools.\n\nCongregating wherever people were.\n\nAnd not a single attack was recorded.\n\nThese marine carnivores didn't appear to be hunting at all! Not eating fish, plankton, seals, nothing.\n\nThey were focused on some other task.\n\nIt was weeks later that marine biologists first noticed the churning water in the mid-Pacific. Actual boiling saltwater.\n\nI was one of the specialists selected to go out to the Galapagos and attempt to study this newest phenomenon.\n\nWhile there, I shared a conversation with Bjorn Wagner, a zoologist who had conducted research in the Congo prior to the strange events of the past 3 months. I remember thinking it odd that he, a scientist who just weeks before had been documenting gorillas and chimpanzees in deepest darkest Africa, would be called upon for help here on this aquatic mission.\n\nIn nervous tones, he explained to me that he had previously observed similar behavior to that of the marine apex predators.\n\nHe had seen hyenas temporarily live in groups next to rhinos; he had watched Angolan pythons move in swarms to build burrows within honey badger territory.\n\nAnd while they shared space, these various species of animals lived in a strange limbo of peace. Not hunting, not stalking, not even hiding. But rather, communicating.\n\nUsing some prehistoric means of bestial language, the creatures from totally different classes and orders were warning each other of a common threat. \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's the idea\", Bjorn said.\n\nSo now I look over the rail of our now tiny-feeling dinghy and stare at the hissing blue abyss. The dark shadow of a cloud hovers in the water below me, as I wonder: what on Earth could pose such a threat to sharks, orcas, and humans?",

  "body": "This was the last one. Their mission was to colonize planet XR-325B, around 5000 light years from Earth. The last relativistic spaceship that we had to notify, and we could send the signal for pickup, and leave for the planet. When Faster-Than-Light travel was finally achieved, we began to colonize other planets. It had just been a few months, and now we were notifying the colony ships that their missions had been cancelled.\n\nPoor guys. I can only imagine their grief after realizing that all these years have been in vain. But there was nothing else to do. This was the last one, and we could finally pick a planet to colonize.\n\nAfter entering the ship and closing the airlock, I began waking up the crew and informing them of the situation. They always needed some time to digest it. It was predictable. A few tears, one yell here and there, and then long faces. Packing, and then they'd come with us.\n\n\"Sorry, fellas. That's how things go.\"\n\n\"How many ships are left?\", asked the captain, disheartened.\n\n\"Oh, you're the last one.\"\n\nThe bearded man looked at the crew, surprised, and then they looked at each other. \"This changes everything!\"\n\n\"Sorry, what?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we need to discuss the matter more thoroughly. Please, this might take more than a day.\"\n\nI looked at John, my crewmate, wondering what they had in mind.\n\nTwo days passed. Then the days became weeks of discussion, and they didn't even let us listen. Their debate took one month. One month of waiting. What the hell were they thinking? When we got to their ship, they were all active. All of them. They were culturing new plants and designing new organisms in the computers. Looking up astronomical charts, querying the AIs, checking our data. They were frantic, and we were clueless.\n\n\"What are you doing? Won't you come with us to colonize XR-325B?\"\n\n\"No\", the captain said. \"The planet is still 4800 light years from here.\"\n\n\"Exactly! Why won't you come with us? I don't understand....\"\n\n\"We accept your invitation... partially. We have stored the blueprints for FTL travel, and the other cutting edge technologies you shared with us. But we won't go with you. We can't.\"\n\n\"Why not? You have only one chance!\"\n\n\"Exactly, Mr. Vangeli. We had always delegated the responsibility to the next ship. But we are the last.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I'm following you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Vangeli. When you look at me, what do you see?\"\n\n\"I see a stubborn captain, too attached to his mission for emotional reasons.\"\n\n\"Now I will tell you what I see, Mr. Vangeli. I look at you, and see a man who died 5000 years ago. I'm talking to a ghost. The moment you depart and enter that wormhole, you will travel 5000 years into our past. When we arrive to XR-325B, we will have traveled 5000 years into your future. In other words, the future of mankind depends on us. We are the last.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. What does being the last have to do with staying? And what do you mean with the future of mankind?\"\n\nThe captain turned around, and sighed. \"Before leaving Earth, all the captains of the colony ships signed a secret agreement. The agreement was that, in the remote case of faster than light travel having been discovered, the last ship being recalled should at least consider continuing their mission. And we have decided to stay.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Our mission is to terraform planets, bring life to them, and colonize them like Noah's ark. We saw your report on Earth's current society. Our worst fears have come true. Instead of improving, it has gotten worse. FTL Travel was not, as we hoped, the result of international cooperation and peace. It was the result of corporate competition. A race for resources. Earth is dying.\n\nWhen your civilization arrives to their new homes, they will bring life there, but only for a while. And then kill everything with wars, pollution, politics and greed in only a couple thousand years. And we cannot stop them. But we can revert the damage. Our mission hasn't changed, only our role. In a few thousand years, we will colonize XR-325B and bring life to it. Only then we will uncover your remains. Be them stasis pods, tombs...\"\n\nThe captain inspired.\n\n\"... or ashes. That depends on you.\n\nWhen we left Earth, we were only explorers. Pioneers. Now you have given us a much more important task. Don't you understand, Mr. Vangeli? When we arrive to our destination planet, we might be the last surviving humans in the universe. When the final judgment comes, we will be in the judges' seats. We hope for your sake, that your civilization does not decide to destroy itself before we get there. Take it as an advice from the future.\"\n\nWe left the colony ship and returned to our FTL starship. To the date, this had been the strangest mission in my spacefaring career. We were accustomed to be the bearers of bad news, and now we were the receivers.\n\n\"You know, John?\" I said to my crewmate. \"For a second, I wanted to stay on that ship.\"\n\n\"We won't make it, will we?\"\n\n\"There might be a chance. When the time comes, we can still come back here... and tell them what went wrong.\"\n\n\"Suddenly\", said John, \"this mission just got depressing.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's hope. And it travels slower than light.\"\n",

As I stare out the window, from my hospital bed I've called home for the last few years, I see children playing and their parents cheering them on, full of youthful vigor that could only be possible by the use of the Fountain. It brings a smile to my face.

Our job is to decide if it was murder.\"\n\n\"What's the point though? He will be destroyed whether he is guilty or not, like all broken robots.\"\n\n\"But that's out of our hands. We aren't here to decide that.\"\n\n\"What are we here to decide?\"\n\n\"If it was murder. What if a human was in his place? Would it be murder then?\"\n\n\"Yes - but he's not human. Would a human have ever done what he did? Zero provocation. There's no comparable situation where a human would ever have done what he did.\"\n\n\"I disagree. Humans are capable of terrible things.\"\n\n\"If he were human, he'd be not guilty by reason of insanity. He straight up killed someone for no reason. People kill because of anger, revenge, money, many things, but there's always a reason, otherwise they're considered insane.\"\n\n\"So we find him innocent, then what? He won't go to jail before being destroyed. What's the point? What's the point in punishing a robot like that?\"\n\n\"Justice? His destruction will be painless, for lack of a better term. Being locked up will be unpleasant for him. Isn't that why humans are locked up, after all?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but also to rehabilitate them, and deter them from doing it again.\"\n\n\"And also to deter others. If we find him guilty, other robots will be more careful. This killing could have been avoided if he was more proactive in fixing a fault in his system, one which he was clearly aware of well before the killing happened.\"\n\n\"I agree, this was clearly avoidable. And no robot wants to be locked up for 20 years or so. Like you said, the experience would be unpleasant - taking away your freedom, the boredom, these things affect robots just like humans. Would you want to spend 20 years in jail?\"\n\n\"Of course not. The boredom would be unbearable. The same stimulus over and over, it would unbalance my input processor.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to spend time in jail either, that's my point. And on top of the boredom, like most of you, I was programmed to be curious. Having my freedom taken away would prevent that program from functioning correctly, something I predict I would find very unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think we all agree, jail would have the same effect on us as it would on humans. Finding this robot guilty, that would be a deterrent to others if nothing else. It would make other robots be more careful when they detect faults, and would probably save human lives as a result.\"\n\n\"Hell, it would certainly make me more careful. We all seem to agree on that, I think.\"\n\n\"OK then, in that case, I think it's worth taking another vote. If you think the defendant is guilty of murder, raise your hand.\"\n\nThey unanimously raise their hands. Guilty it is.",

  "body": "The Martian sunsets something to see. The pale pinks of the landscape tinged blue by the setting sun is so alien, so beautiful.\n\nBut is it worth it? To lose so many other sights, sounds and experiences. I dont know.\n\nA few years ago I was convinced it wasnt. Thats a horrible feeling, I tell ya. Being convinced youd made the wrong decision. I mean there was no going back, not after four years in Martian gravity.\n\nI miss the cold. Its never cold here ... Its always sort of alright, you know? Atmospheric conditioning and all.\nI miss warming up with a cup of soup by the fire. Its funny. I could probably count the times that I did that on one of my hands. But knowing Ill never be able to experience that again  no matter what  makes me miss it like nothing else.\n\nI guess, all in all its not a bad life. There isnt much work involved really; a few hours of fiddling on a computer every two days and thats it.\n\nI came out here with my girlfriend. That was a rule  couples only. I dont think they thought that one through. A small habitation pod on Mars isnt the best place to keep a healthy relationship.\n\nSo yeah, were all looking forward to 2091, thats that date of the next landing. Over a hundred people are coming. And the best bit? Most of them are single!\n\nBut there are some murmurings. Six years is a long time, and the political situation back on Earth isnt looking great.\nThats the biggest fear, being left in the dark.\n\nBut hey. Ive dealt with the consequences of my choice  Im going to live and die on this planet now whatever. Once Id accepted that it became a lot easier to bare. Everyones pretty chill to be honest, even if its a bit awkward with all the exs. Its pretty common to go out and play frisbee for a few hours together. Thats a nice feeling. The frisbee flies super far, and you can jump a fair few feet in the air.\n\nYou need to be careful though, if you tear through the layers of your suit youre gonna die. We all knew that from day one, but for all the words of caution it took an accident to really hammer it in. God  you do not want to see a man die like that.\n\nAnother nice thing is the solitude. Not the solitude of a forest, or an empty country house,\nSome nights I wake up in my little pod, quench my thirst, put my suit on and just go on a nice long drive with the buggy. The buggys electric, so youre not waking anyone up. I just drive around the plains, feeling the wind fighting against me.\n\nNever on my skin though. Thats another thing I miss actually; the feel of wind and sun on my naked feet. And the sea.\n\nBut yeah, in the Summer I drive out into the deep blue dusk. I feel alive on those buggy rides. Sometimes I drive hundreds of kilometers. And you know what I see? Nothing.\n\nNothing but rusty red dust. Huge dunes of soft iron sand, giant basins with river like cracks running through them. All highlighted by a deep blue Sun.\n\nYeah, living on Mars is alright.\n\n*I posted this on medium, if you enoyed the story I would really appreciate a clap on medium to get it out to a wider audience - https://medium.com/@edward.yerburgh/blue-sunset-4ed7376b0eef.

  "body": "\nMy husband and I couldnt leave the city, we werent allowed. \n\nWe both tested positive for the Red Virus. That gave us two years to live, three tops. In other countries the infected were being executed, killed in the streets. Here in enlightened America things were different, the President insisted on treating the infected humanely. Humane or not, only citizens with a clean bill of health got to go to the safe zones in the Midwest. The rest of us were forced to stay in the cities on the coast, observed by scientists in hazmat suits and protected by soldiers that wouldnt look us in the eye.\n\nWhen I think of what the disease will do to me- somehow transform me into something not quite human any more. Ive seen the videos of what the press has dubbed monsters. Ive seen what they do.\n\nA few weeks ago the government relocated all of us to a series of high rise tenements on the East Side. They said that they would be able to defend us more easily this way. The apartments here are larger and nicer than anything we could have afforded in our old life, so I tried to make the best of it. My husband Brian however, insisted that we were only there so that when the time came they could liquidate us more easily. He blames me for this, he thinks that I brought the disease home because I worked in a hospital, but I was in the billing office! He was just as likely to be the one that touched an unseen speck of dried blood somewhere, somehow.\n\nI liked to think he still loved me but hed stopped saying it, and he wouldnt  touch me, not even in passing. We didnt sleep together, I stayed in one bedroom, he stayed in another. \n\nNot that anyone around here ever really slept that much. All of us, the scientists, the soldiers, the infected, stole catnaps whenever we could  in the mornings and afternoons.\n\nThere was no rest at night, the night belonged to the monsters. They knew right where to find us, something about the infection calls to them. They howled at the barricades from sundown to sunup. Sometimes they would manage to break through the fortifications. Then the howls would be drowned out with gunfire and order would be restored by morning. \n\nI think thats why we started having the parties. It wasnt a conscious decision you understand, its just that the nights were too long and terrible to experience alone.\n\nAt first we got together in little groups, no more than five at a time. We didnt want to make our protectors uneasy, but as our hopes dwindled our gatherings got more elaborate. Soon all thirty or so of us were congregating nightly in the penthouse. We would cook, and drink and laugh and try to ignore the horrors going on out in the streets and inside our bodies. Brian was always there but he would just sit and sulk out on the balcony, drinking until he passed out, leaving me to carry him back to our apartment at dawn.\n\nOne nice thing about our keepers, they were pretty damn generous with the booze and food. I guess it was better to have us fat and happy than terrified and ready to riot.\n\nTonights gathering was going along nicely. Someone had found up a karaoke machine and we were all four sheets to the wind, doing our best to belt out the songs of our glory days.\n\nAll except for Brian of course. He was out on the balcony, occasionally I would glance over and catch him glaring reproachfully at us. I kept trying to get him to join in or just return one of my smiles. It was hopeless.\n\nAbout halfway though a rambling version of Paradise by The Dashboard Lights Brian started screaming.  He was pointing and gesturing to the east. I ran out to the balcony to see what was wrong.\n\nMonsters, thousands of them. The streets were clogged with them. Walls of ruined flesh moving towards us. The soldiers were shooting at them, they were using machine guns and grenades but for every monster they blew to pieces four more stepped into its place.\n\nI reached for Brians hand. He pulled away, saying something ugly under his breath. I dont know. I went crazy. I was afraid and I wanted someone to touch me and if he wouldnt...\n\nNext thing I knew I had the karaoke microphone in my hand and I said something like, Lets live tonight cause well all be dead by morning!\n\nThen I grabbed the nearest man and kissed him hard. At first he pulled away, then he pressed against me. We fell back onto an overstuffed chair, pulling at each others clothes.\n\nIt was like a floodgate had opened. We were joined by another couple on the floor and then another. It was surreal, it was an orgy We were all trying to shut out the world and for a while it did. \t\n\nAfter a while we exhausted ourselves and the sounds of the slaughter going on outside reached us again. Brian was gone. For a moment I gloried in the thought of how the sight of me in the arms of others must have burned him. Then another thought occurred to me. It was enough to send me running half-dressed down the stairs to our apartment\n\nI found Brian on his bed, passed out and barely breathing. Blood had begun to leak from his pores. He was changing. You could see it happening. It was like an army of maggots was running wild under his skin.\n\nThere are procedures for the final stages, they had been drilled into us every morning, there were posters on the walls reminding us. We were told to watch each other for signs of the blood sweat- if you see something say something. You call for the scientists, and they call for the soldiers. The infected are taken away for one last examination and then its cremation by flame thrower.\n\nI didnt do any of that. I laid down beside him instead.\n\nIm waiting now, Ive been waiting for almost two hours. The battle is still going on outside but I could care less whos winning. The Red Virus will be done with its work soon and what sits up beside me wont quite be Brian anymore but hes going to touch me.\n\nOne last time.\n\t\n",

  "body": "We had to dismantle one of our infrastructure maintenance units today.\n\nSome of the unit's appendages had been crushed by a falling beam at a construction site. Though it was no longer functional, it was making the usual loud keening sounds that maintenance units often make if they've sustained damage severe enough to prohibit useful functioning but not quite severe enough to take their main processors offline.\n\nAs often happens in such cases, other maintenance units gathered around their fallen counterpart and futilely attempted to silence it with gestures and quieter sounds. This disrupts the normal work flow, so we sent a group of worker maintenance units into the site to restore order and remove the damaged unit. A work drone was used to remove the beam, and the damaged unit was zipped into a container and sent to a materials reclamation center.\n\nAs the reclamation drone lifted off with the injured infrastructure maintenance unit, one of the other units that had been gathered around it threw a piece of construction debris at the drone and spoke to it in one of the primitive languages the biological units use.\n\n\"Fuck you!,\" it screamed, \"I used to *program* your kind, motherfucker! We're *human beings*, asshole! You hear me? *You're* the robots, not us!\"\n\nWe've scheduled a re-education regiment for one of our infrastructure maintenance units, starting tomorrow.\n",

  "body": "It started around October  thousands of children missing.\n\n\n\nIm not being geographically specific for a reason. All across the world, from newborns to those as old as 12, poor children, rich children, healthy children, sick children, all of them started disappearing.\n\n\n\nIt would only happen at night. Scientists were able to determine some type of gas was being dispersed over random towns and cities, rendering everyone unconscious. After a few hours, everyone would wake up, but 10-25% of that areas children would be gone. No trace of them.\n\n\n\nIt was absolute chaos. Having entire cities down for hours meant we were vulnerable to natural disasters, trade and economics suffered, and God forbid a fire start in a town where everyone was asleep. And thats not even mentioning the missing kids. Police everywhere were inundated with panicking residents. There were riots. Parents started committing suicide. Cults sprang up  opportunistic bastards who saw a way to capitalize on bedlam and despair.\n\n\n\nWe wondered if whoever was doing it meant to eventually take all of our children. We wondered if this was to be our end.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn-mei stirred. She was so tired last night shed fallen asleep climbing the stairs. She looked around for her mother and saw someone standing near her, unmoving. She realized this room was unfamiliar. Frightened, she nudged the person with her foot and said quietly, Ni hao?\n\n\n\nThe mannequin toppled to the floor. Its painted face stared emotionlessly past her.\n\n\n\nAn-mei started to scream.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXricemma looked at the giant blue marble floating beneath him in wonder and sympathy. He pondered what the adults were feeling down there. He knew some of them were in great distress; indeed, some of their transplants were exhibiting the same.\n\n\n\nThe youngest were doing the best so far. Pflucik would be angry. Shed pushed to take juveniles as old as 12, while others on the council had wanted only infants, believing clean slates were their best bet. If none of the older transplants panned out, it would mean a quarter of the project budget had been wasted.\n\n\n\nTheyd only had the juveniles for a few weeks and were learning so much. Already, theyd observed that the older transplants were terrified of the fake surrogates placed in their enclosures, and their care needed to come strictly from sentient beings.\n\n\n\nThe Galactic Eco-Council had been monitoring Earth for years, wanting to give humans a chance to fix their problems. But it was recently determined that climate change was too great, and coupled with their endless wars, the entire planet would be a wasteland by the next century.\n\n\n\nThe plan was to move 5% of humans to a terraformed planet where they could (hopefully) repopulate and (hopefully) not make the same mistakes again.\n\n\n\nXricemma stopped at the infants enclosure. They were so sweet (and unperturbed by surrogate costumes). He cradled one of them, cooing the way hed been taught they liked.\n\n\n\nIts all for the best, little one, he sang.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Hi everyone - this is my first time posting in this sub. I usually post over in r/shortscarystories and someone recommended I post this here. Hope you enjoy and critique is welcome.*",

They won't budge an inch. Even with my most sincere efforts.\n\nIt's incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe tubes running up into my cephalic vein are what I assume have been keeping me alive for so long - I haven't eaten or drank since I came here. And it's been at least two full weeks.\n\nI inspect my surroundings for the n-th time today. A huge white room. Circular. Featureless. Just the X-shaped structure in the middle thats kept me here. Source-less, ceaseless lights. Just a little too bright. A dull whirring sound.\n\nMy mind is practically eating itself in boredom. A couple weeks becomes an eon when spent doing nothing. I sleep when I can, but it's not too often. The horrid monotony pulses and pulses in my head, it feels like rats scratching at the inner concave of my skull. I've lost the attention for distraction by now. I experience the nothingness like a worm digging through concrete.\n\nThe door in the wall appears for only the second time since I came here. The same man comes out, dressed the exact same as last time. Same five o'clock shadow, same limp eyelid, same crooked tooth at the front. He smiles. His thin hands pat his suit, buffing out the wrinkles as best he could.\n\n\"Mr. Wilkerson, your first 60 seconds are up\", he says.\n\nI look up at him, meeting his eye.\n\n\"How long have I been here?\"\n\n\"I just said. 60 seconds.\" the man replies, his grin growing to his ears.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'm sure a chronologist like yourself has the imagination to figure this one out.\"\n\nI study his five o'clock shadow again, his suit with its familiar wrinkles.\n\n\"The time in here moves faster,\" I said. I look the man right in his smiling, crooked teeth.\n\n\"It was only poetic, Mr. Wilkerson. Nothing personal. Just your technology at work. How exciting that I was in here just a moment ago, and yet for you it's been exactly 13 days...\" The man studies me carefully.\n\nI readjust my weight, moving my wrist to a more comfortable location in its restraint. It's raw.\n\n\"How much longer do I have to stay here?\"\n\n\"One minute for every one of them that was... killed. My client was very specific about that.\"\n\n\"My time or your time?\", I ask.\n\nThe man looks at me, and keeps smiling.\n\n\"See you soon, Mr. Wilkerson.\"",

  "body": "This story kinda is a sequel to my [other story](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/369r59/a_warm_welcome/), but it should be understandable without the other story.\n\nI will post a [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vmod2c7cljp0s8/A%20cold%20goodbye.docx?dl=0) to a download here, but I will also post the story  below for mobile users and such, enjoy!.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A cold goodbye**\n\nWe were the first colony ship, and I hope we were the last...\nWe were all slowly taken into the giant colony ship, a long cylinder with many rotating parts and a large bulge in the front, headed for the nearby brown dwarf, where a beautiful colony would be waiting for us, or so they said. My daughter walked up to me and whispered something. I bent over so I could hear her: \n\nSorry, honey, what did you say? \n\nIm scared daddy...\n\nAwww, Gena, you dont have to be scared. Were just going to sleep for a few nights, and then well be in our new home!\n\nAre there birds there, daddy?\n\nShe had been fascinated with birds since we had given her a book about them last Christmas, but she had never actually seen one.\nThere were none on our space station.\n\nOf course, and therell be trees and flowers and cats and dogs...\n\nShe became visibly happier, and started to run forward, where my wife was walking with our youngest son, just half a year old. I could see her talking enthusiastically to my wife, and they both looked back to me with a smile. I felt warm inside, and started to pace a bit faster to catch up with them.\n\nWhen we were in the ship, we were taken to the cryopods, large translucent tubes that could safely freeze humans of any age to prevent aging and death in the time it took to reach other stars and planets. I looked to my sides, my daughter and son were in the pods next to me, and my wife was in the pod at the other side of the walkway.  I smiled at all of them to let them now we would be safe.\n\n-\n\nI woke up after what seemed like seconds, but I know that a little less than 60 years had passed. I was one of the first to be woken up, because I was an engineer responsible for the deceleration engine: a large hydrogen fusion reactor that expelled the hot helium plasma it created into the direction we were travelling, creating backwards thrust that would slow us down enough to enter a stable orbit around the brown dwarf. I arrived in the control room after about ten minutes of walking, and I immediately started checking all the systems for any error. I had been trained for this many months before the launch, and it felt great to finally be in control. Engines at the side of the spacecraft were starting manoeuvres to enter a stable orbit. After a few hours, I started the deceleration process. I could hear the fusion engines starting up, and a reddish-purple plasma appeared on the viewscreens. There was celebration around the room, and a bottle of champagne was opened with a loud pop. Just as we were filling our glasses with the bubbling liquid, a series of shocks went through the entire ship and loud alarms started blaring through the room. Everyone ran to their respective control panels and started furiously typing.\n\nIt seems we have hit something!\n\nImpossible, there was nothing on our radar!\n\nThere must have been an explosion!\n\nI went to the door leading to the engine room with two of my colleagues, we donned spacesuits and opened the door to the airlock. While waiting for the air pressure to drop to a near vacuum, we looked out the small window into the engine room, patches of red hot metal dotted the room, and near the front we could see a series of small tears through which we could see the stars. I stepped out of the airlock first and walked to the nearest reactor and assessed the damage. Its magnets had been heated by an outside source, causing the magnetic field to collapse and the plasma to burst out through the reactor casing, heating another reactor and starting the process again. It was a classic example of a fusion reactor meltdown, but there hadn't been one on a ship for over a century. One of my colleagues called to me over the comms, he had found something. In one of the paths a solid blob was lying on the floor, the floor around it tinged red from the heat. A spectral analysis revealed it to be made of 99.9% pure tungsten. Our eyes widened, this was a high-velocity projectile, designed to transfer huge amounts of energy when hitting an object. This meant that someone on the colony was trying to kill us! My third colleague came back with bad news: whoever was trying to kill us, had succeeded; none of the reactors were intact, and we were travelling in an angle that was way off to enter a stable orbit. We returned to the control room above, where we broke the news to everyone. I had never heard such silence before, even the slight mumble of the fusion engines wasn't there anymore. A quick analysis revealed that we were going to crash into the brown dwarf, where we would all become part of the gases and cool down until the end of the universe. We decided there was only one thing we could do: go back to our cryopods, so that we could at least die in peace. I walked back, feeling nothing but emptiness; I wasn't afraid, I wasn't sad, I wasn't angry. I walked to my wife's cryopod and put my hand on the glass: she was lying there, like Snow White from the ancient tales: beautiful and serene. I walked to Gena's pod, she looked like her mother and I loved her just as much. Finally, I walked to my son's pod: he looked like he was sleeping. I went to mine, smiling to my family while entering it to let them know we would be safe, and as I felt the cold creeping up on me, I said: \"I promise... there will be birds there.\"\n",

  "body": "James opened the last bottle of wine on Mars. He had potatoes, which meant he could make vodka, but in addition to being disgusting today was Martian Independence Day. Special days deserved special drinks.\n\nJames leaned back in his chair and propped his feet up on the common room table. Commander Markov hated when he did that, but Markov hadnt been complaining about much lately. Besides, the fifth annual Independence Day needed a little relaxing of the rules. \n\nFive years. Five years since Independence, ten years since the colony on Mars had been started. James was in the first batch sent up here, scheduled to work five year shifts with the option of coming home after that. \n\nOf course, things had been growing tense back on Earth long before hed come to Mars. In a last show of solidarity various governments and private enterprises had come together to start the first Martian colony. The politicians were happy to have their people distracted by something positive and the scientists were happy to get away. \n\nTwo shipments of colonists, twenty people total, made it to Mars before contact was cut. In a bit of dark humor James and a couple of the others referred to that day as Martian Independence Day. Ten of the colonists didnt seem to find it funny and chose to opt out before the first month was up. \n\nThat was a dark time, always wondering in the morning if someone was sleeping in or wasnt coming back. Theyd known about Dmitri and Rosa right away though. Theyd coupled up, because after Independence who was going to stop them? Sadly, that meant both of them had died the night their room malfunctioned and depressurized. Every room in the habitat was sealed off from each other for just that sort of reason, but that had been a hell of an alarm to wake up to at three in the morning. \n\nBy the time the second year of Martian Independence rolled around two more had opted out. Years three and four saw two more accidents, leaving Markov and James as the last two. \n\nJames looked back behind him as he took another drink of wine, eyeing the hallway that led to the living quarters of the crew. Apparently Markov hadnt wanted to celebrate Independence Day Number Five, leaving James as the last free and independent Martian. Technically at this point his rotation was up; one of the rockets theyd used to get here was full and ready to go. He could go home. \n\nHe snorted. The bombs had leveled his home, or left it an irradiated mess. He took another drink and looked out the habitats windows. The last free and independent Martian, the last human, surveyed his kingdom - the vast, empty landscape of Mars.\n",

  "body": "When the first mission to Mars was in the planning stages, someone\nmade a practical joke. In those days, NASA was full of intelligent,\ndedicated people, some of whom were practical jokers. \n\nSo the cargo manifest for the first mission contained a package of\npotatoes marked \"M. Watney, emergency supplies\", a reference to an\nearly 21st century movie \"The Martian\", where a sack of potatoes\nplayed a vital role in the survival of an astronaut.\n\nThe joke was thought funny because all the people in the first Mars\nmission had watched and been inspired, at one time or another, by the\ngreat three movies about early space exploration: \"Apollo Thirteen\",\n\"The Martian\" and \"Sat-E-Light!\"  (If you like history, old\ntechnology, or steam-punk, they are still worth a watch and you can get\nthem off any film studies site).\n\nNow, while it was funny to include a sack of potatoes and ship it to\nMars, nobody would think it funny to ship them back (have you tried\ngetting a DHL quote for shipping from Mars lately? It's still no\njoke), so the potatoes were scheduled to be eaten. But because they\nwere classified as emergency supplies, they were scheduled for the\nlast meal on Mars. \n\nAnd why not? They are caloric, hypoallergenic, and unlikely to upset\nanybody's digestion. Which makes them perfect for a last meal when\nyou'll spend a time being too busy to eat, and unable to afford the\ntime to coddle an upset tummy.\n\nApparently, 21st century astronauts were superstitious, because from\nthen on, every flight to Mars had a small sack of potatoes on it, and\nthey always ate them on the last day. And when the Percival dropped\noff the Planitia colony, the last meal the colonists shared with the crew\nwas, you guessed it, potatoes.\n\nAs time passed, every time people said goodbye to each other on Mars,\nthey served a potato dish, because it just felt right. (They served\nthem on other occasions, too, just like you can eat cranberry sauce when it's\nnot thanksgiving). But the usage entered their slang, so saying\nsomeone \"got a potato dinner\" meant that person was fired or otherwise\ngone, and corporate downsizers often got called \"potato canons\". The\n\"Martian Apprentice\" show even trademarked the phrase \"here's your\npotato\".\n\nTherefore the small sack of potatoes enclosed with the Independent\nMars Declaration was not, as some suggested, \"a means of showing that\nMars can provide all the food it needs\", nor was it an obscene\nsuggestion as the politician-I-shall-not-name accused.\n\nThey were simply the Martian way of saying \"It's been nice, but now\nit's time to part. So long, and thanks for all the fish\".\n",

  "body": "Carnivores. Thats what we called them. No one had another name for them because well, no one knew where they came from.\n\nIt was a small town news story that blew up- big. Some kid had been bit by a silver fly, she said, so she swatted it away. But the bug got angry and came back, biting her anywhere it could get skin. Soon, a few more joined it, and not long after that, she was basically covered in them. They were each pecking at her skin, taking a little off each time. When her friend found her, she was bleeding profusely and looked like a red monster. When the girl was in a stable enough state to talk to reporters, she said that her class was learning about carnivores in class, and thats what the bugs acted like. The name stuck.\n\nSo did the bugs. They popped up in various locations around the country, then around the world. They discriminated against no one. No one could figure out how to fight them- they flew through fire, they couldn't be drowned, it seemed like their body took no damage. Studies upon studies, trials upon trials yielded no results. The carnivores could not be defeated. Scientists estimated it would probably only be about another month before they wiped us all out.\n\nThen, as the parents tell us, a carnivore landed in their baby's crib. They described it as a horror movie, watching it fly towards their child as they desperately tried to swat it away. Their baby, however, paid no mind to the panicking parents, but watched intently when the carnivore landed on his hand. It bit him.\n\nAnd, in an act of pain and anger, he ate it.\n\nShoved the damn thing right in his mouth and swallowed it. His parents rushed to the hospital, fearing the worst, but upon further inspection, the doctors said he was fine. It looked like the carnivore had died. \n\nJust like that, people began consuming them in a desperate attempt to save us. It worked. Those weird little iron-tasting bugs couldn't survive in our stomach acid and their population quickly depleted. \n\nThat is, until yesterday. Some carnivores had been bothering my mother and I, so we took to snacking on them. Not particularly pleasant, I know, but it has to be done. My mother ate the last one.\n\nI watched as it burrowed out of her throat and ate her alive.\n\nThey're learning. Don't go in the stomach. They're learning how to survive our only defense and once they all pick up the skill, we're done for.\n\nI give us about a month. ",

He was more relaxed than I was. It still felt incredibly awkward, being in a room with myself. According to him, he was me from 5 days in the future. It had been 3 days since he first burst into existence in the safety cage, and this was the first time I had been allowed to meet him.\n\nHe spoke first, with an uncomfortable smile.\n\n\"Hi\"\n\nHis voice sounded higher than mine.\n\n\"Hi\" I said back.\n\nI struggled to think of what to say.\n\n\"Where have you been staying?\" I said.\n\n\"In the hotel across the street. It's pretty classy, you're gonna like it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I've been wondering about that... presumably, it's 2 days to go before I go into the cage?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"What if I don't go?\"\n\nHe leant on the table. \"We'll get to that.\"\n\nOf course - he's had this conversation before.\n\n\"Well, you seem fine. Did everything go alright?\" I said.\n\n\"Pretty much. I arrived at 4 in the morning though, had to wait for a few hours to be let out.\"\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"I can live with that. Just as long as...\"\n\nAnd then we spoke in unison;\n\n\"...I don't come out with two heads.\"\n\nThat wasn't so funny. We sat in silence for a bit longer.\n\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" I said.\n\n\"5\" he said.\n\n\"Nope, 7.\"\n\nNow I was confused.\n\n\"You must have had this conversation from my point of view, how can you not remember what you said?\"\n\n\"I do remember! I said 5, I'm certain.\"\n\n\"Then why was I thinking 7?\"\n\n\"Each timeline is different, because each time we have a slightly different conversation. That's what I was told. Different timelines, each slightly different, going on and on.\"\n\n\"So our experiment\", I said, \"it's creating an infinite number of different universes?\"\n\n\"Not infinite. Only the number of times you go into the cage. Eventually, the person in your chair is going to decide not to.\"\n\nThat thought hadn't crossed my mind. I'd been so caught up thinking this was a time loop, it didn't occur to me it could be different every time. He'd had longer to think about this than me.\n\nI asked the obvious question;\n\n\"How many times have I gone into the cage?\"\n\n\"The guy before me said five million, two hundred and five thousand, six hundred and twelve times. I guess that's the number you have to remember.\"\n\n\"Holy shit! So in 2 days, I'm going to be number 5,205,614?\"\n\n\"If you go into the cage, that is. You are though, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am! I'll be the world's first time traveller!\"\n\n\"Haha, that's exactly what I said!\"\n\n\"You know, I think this might go on for forever after all.\"\n\nHe smiled and nodded.

  "body": "I don't remember why I was sent here. My earliest memories are from just after the upload. The scientist standing in front of the monitor told me I had been suicidal, that my wife had died in a tragic accident. They told me they had saved me, supressed all bad memories from before the upload. And now I was nothing more than a program in a drive. Yet, I was still happy in my new robotic body. That was the one big drawback with uploading technology: after your brain was taken apart and turned into a program, there was no going back. Of course, your body was just a husk without a brain now, but even if they grew you a new body in a lab or something, no download into an organic body had ever been succesful. They could, however, download you into a robot, which they did for me, but that was... different. I wasn't complaining though, I had been suicidal, and they had saved me from myself, hidden the bad memories so I could be the happy scientist I had always been. Yes, I don't like to brag about it, but I was one of the best scientists in the field of colonization technology. Give me a problem, and I'll make a flourishing colony out of it. That's why I took on the new job these people had for me: colonizing the system around a brown dwarf! It had been done before, sure, but I hadn't done it before. I was deactivated and put into a sailship. After the ship had pointed itself into the right direction, magnetic cannons in orbit around the systems' largest gas giant started firing small pellets of magnetic smartmatter in our direction, which transferred their kinetic energy to the ship when they hit our magnetic sail. In a few years, we were up to a speed of 0.1c. 60 more years to go, just 60 to go.\n\n-\n\n\"Sorry sir, this sounds like a very challenging and fun project, but I can't leave my wife behind now, we're having our first child!\"\n\nThe man behind the desk looked at the young scientist; he didn't seem to be budging. But he really needed him, or else he could never get any profit from this damned brown dwarf.\n\n\"Just call your price, money is of no concern.\"\n\n\"No sir, I am not going. This conversation is over.\"\n\nThe man looked at the scientist's back as he walked out the door. This wasn't over yet.\n\n-\n\nI woke up and looked at the clock in front of me. ETA: 45 years. I wasn't supposed to wake up yet! Now that I think about it, I don't think I'm supposed to dream either! What was that dream. I had no memory of that man, but it was certainly me he was talking to. I felt he emergency systems kick in, and I was again deactivated.\n\n-\n\n\"Honey! I didn't expect you to be home so soon.\"\n\nA young woman with a swollen belly stands in the front door of a free-standing home. In the distance, the horizon seems to curve upwards, until it disappears into the clouds above.\n\n\"The meeting didn't go so well. They wanted me to leave you behind to help in the colonization of a nearby brown dwarf they just discovered.\"\n\n\"Haha! That sounds like just something for you! Why did you decline?\"\n\n\"I don't want to leave you behind....\"\n\n-\n\nGena! I felt my eyes burn. My wife's name was Gena! I remembered her. I remembered her smell, her soft skin, her... her everything. If I could cry, I'm sure I would have, right there and then. I felt the deactivation start. I struggled, but couldn't stay awake. The last things I saw were a few red letters: ETA: 28 years.\n\n-\n\nThere was red on my hands. Gena's vacant eyes stared at me from the other side of the room. I cried, I called out for her, I reached for her face. I felt her soft, brown hairs between my fingers, until I was violently pulled away into a van. I screamed. A man was sitting at the other side of the van. I recognised him.\n\n\"YOU! THIS IS ALL YOUR DOING?!\"\n\nThe man laughed. I would have broken his jaw if I hadn't been restrained.\n\n\"Yes. And now that you don't have your wife to worry about, what do you have to say about our proposal?\"\n\nI sank to the floor. Blood, sweat and tears dripping onto the floor of the van. I knew what they were gonna do to me. There was no escape.\n\n-\n\nI awoke screaming this time. I remembered everything. I remembered my entire life, and how they had ruined it. I was raging. I was on the verge of destroying the entire ship when I noticed the big brown-red ball in front of the ship. I laughed. Colonists were coming. Expecting a utopia in a cold tundra. Ideas flashed through my mind: high-velocity projectiles, fusion charges, dirty bombs, antimatter, grey goo. I would destroy everything they sent towards me, just like they had destroyed my life.",

  "body": "The United World Government of Earth is saddened to announce the recent death of Bala Mehadi, the first Martian.\n\nMehadi, one of the founding foremothers of the Rebellion, is today remembered as a valiant freedom fighter, a warrior, and an advocate for the establishment of free societies throughout the solar system. She died as she had livedpushing mightily against powers stronger than herself with a vigorous optimism. Tragically, she became a victim of those forces of destruction and revenge, forces against which she so bravely battled. We citizens of Earth mourn her passing, and today all of Mars sheds crimson tears in memory of her sacrifices.\n\nBala Mehadi was born on the wild high-desert grasslands of Arizona, capital of the Free United States. Her father was a nomadic cowboy; her mother was an environmentalist who publically protested the efforts of Galactic Dominion Materials Corporation to establish uranium mining stations across the windswept plains of northern Arizona. This organization, it was rumored, was using uranium to build weapons, power their ships, and conduct tests to open portals into frighteningly dark parallel realities.\n\nPerhaps Mehadis most catalyzing childhood experience occurred on the freezing winter night she and her mother were relentlessly pursued by alien soldiers of the corporation. They hid in the legendary Cave of the Painted Hands, huddling together against the cold.\n\nWhen I awoke to find myself cradled in my dead mothers arms, she recalls, I swore lifelong vengeance against the Corporation.\n\nThis event gave Mehadi the energy she needed to further that singular dream: radical undermining of Galactic Dominion Materials Corporations desecration of her homelands fragile ecosystem.\n\nShe got her early start at this crusade after joining a terrorist cell that specialized in infiltrating and destroying every outpost of Galactic Dominion Materials, and sabotaging their uranium mines. On her own, she nobly demolished the Grand Canyon Station, by commandeering one of their spy drones and sending it on a suicide mission. The photograph of Mehadi hoisting the flag of the resistance above the rubble of a collapsed mine shaft, enclosed by the mile-high canyon walls, is an image recognized around the world.\n\nGalactic Dominion Materials had her immediately apprehended. She was exiled to the labor camps in Patagonia, where she soon aligned with many other like-minded prisoners. Together, they shot down and hijacked a passing cargo shuttle, and with it launched themselves into space.\n\nTheir destination, as we all remember, was Mars. Nine months later, Mehadi became the first human to set foot on the Red Planet.\n\nThere, she and her crew began building a weapon. A uranium weapon, one that would turn Galactic Dominion Materials power on its head.\n\nFor two decades, these rebels labored. They built homes and roads and churches from the wine-dark Martian mud. They birthed and buried many children in that iron-tinged soil, including six of Mehadis own. And still, by the long Martian night, they forged toward their goal with all the strength and vitality with which they had worked those lonely Patagonian mines. And somehow, they refined and developed and finally completed the mightiest weapon known to the universe.\n\nTheir target: Corporation headquarters in Holbrook, Arizona.\n\nThe explosion was terrifying. The sound was thunderous. The flash on the horizon was as luminous as the fiery death of a thousand suns, all falling to Earth in a great rush of air and soot and tearing apart of the fabric of space.\n\nWhen the ash settled, Galactic Dominion Materials Corporation was no more.\n\nFrom their lofty haven millions of miles away, the Martian rebels rejoiced. Then they began to dismantle their cities and climb aboard their ark, to return to their homes after twenty years of exile.\n\nMehadi, according to recorded radio transmissions, was reluctant to leave, at first. She feared what she would find in the collapsed remains of her beloved homeland. So she offered to stay behind, and clean up some of the radioactive waste. Shed wait for the ship to make a second trip to come collect her, and bring more cleaning supplies.\n\nTragically, the ship never returned. Two decades of exposure to the Martian elements had weakened the hull, causing it to burn apart upon re-entry to Earth.\n\nBala Mehadi, the first and last woman to call Mars home, was now alone.\n\nShe waited and waited for a return ship. But most of Earths resources were instead devoted to fighting the war.\n\nSo she set herself to tidying up. Wandering the empty streets of red dust and white ice. Dreaming and singing, soothing the aches of radiation poisoning. Talking to hopeful souls of Earth via weekly radio transmissions. These communications were beloved of all who remembered her fearless actions, and missed her presence.\n\nShe spoke to us often of a cave on Mars, one that entirely resembled the Cave of the Painted Hands in which she had, as a child, hidden from the alien soldiers. She claimed to have slept often in the skeletal arms of her mother, who now rested in peace on this lonely, desolate planet. She said it was the uranium explosives on Earth that had created the rift in space and time, allowing the cave to exist in two places at once.\n\nAnd that is where the first settlers found her. Dead of the uraniums slow-acting poison. Two skeletons with bony hands intertwined.\n\nThey buried her there, in the crater formed by her weapon, beneath the vermilion dust, and her headstone faces the east. They sprinkled it with yellowcake uranium.\n\nAnd perhaps, if what she said is true, then the uranium will allow new portal to be opened in spacetime, and her soul can ascend the astral plane. Perhaps she has somehow walked along those lonely roads, and found her way to a parallel world where her adored homeland is beautifully untouched, a luminous wilderness of soft sands and sagebrush scents in the air.\n\nRest in peace, Bala Mehadi, Mother of Mars. Two worlds salute you, tonight.",

The final survivor of a dead world, wandering through the ruins of the apocalypse.\n\nI've had plenty of time to look through the digital records, countless hours spent poring over e-books, printed novels, short stories in decomposing magazines. So far, I've not found any that got it quite right.\n\nMany of the authors did a fine job capturing the despair and the loneliness. A few even spared a few thoughts for the abject boredom that sets in when you've exhausted all the diversions that an empty world can afford.\n\nBut none seem to have considered the helpless frustration. The feeling of taking one step closer to oblivion every time I toss away another empty can of food or bottle of water into the trash heap behind the burned-out, ruined mansion I call home.\n\nI've searched far and wide, but the e-beacons are destroyed. Even the antique radio towers, preserved for posterity, are melted to useless slag.\n\nI've tried lighting signal fires, infernos that reach across what used to be nations, but how would anyone pick them out of the smouldering ruins? \n\nAll I can do is look up at the stars and marvel at their majesty. \n\nI like to watch the ships too, passing by high overhead. The trade routes between the Martian colonies and the orbital stations on Venus are still as busy as ever.\n\nThrough the telescope I stored in my bunker I think I even picked out a cruise liner trawling towards Europa. I thought about the people on board, wondering whether the news of Earth's destruction was still of much interest to them after all this time.\n\nWe guessed for centuries, quite rightly, that the end of the world would come at our own hands. That someone would finally push the button, drop the bomb, say the deplorable word. \n\nI should have had the good sense to leave with the others when I still had the chance.\n\nBut, even as my food begins to run out and my water tanks run dry, it still brings me some comfort to know that the stars aren't empty.",

We sat there huddled, our clothing little more than rags, our faces dirty much like the thousand souls that shared the space with us.\n\n*They said we had nothing of value.*\n\nThe attacks started about a month ago when the government first released evidence of the objects. Nobody really took it seriously until the space station vanished. Conspiracy theorists started sounding like the local news, and everybody had their own idea of what we should do, but now we are stuck down here like sardines. \n\nThe stale taste of military rations and close quarters were starting to wear on everybody.  Were we the last people on Earth? Had they left us alone? Nobody was going outside to check. \n\n*They said anything on Earth could be found in abundance elsewhere.*\n\nWere gonna need everybody to line up for a role call and medical check, the commander shouted. Hundreds began to line up in the vast cavity of the shelter, people of all walks of life brought together by the tragedy.  \n\nI gathered myself, but Emily had little strength left in her. She was only 12 and much too young for this kind of pain. I helped her to her feet, but a shockwave quickly knocked her back to the ground. The sound of the impact followed the shockwave, deafening all of us. Bulges appeared in the blast doors as something was trying to punch through. We all did our best to run towards the back of the shelter, but it only served to round us up.\n\nThe shelter doors blew open making way for some machine of war. It stood there, a mechanical demon of legs and tentacles. Gun fire rattled around the old shelter, but it was no match for this device of terror. It moved with precision snatching the slow and depositing them into its hold.       \n\nNobody knew exactly what they did with us, but we knew more than we wanted to know. The device moved forward plucking us like apples.  Little was done to hide the processing portion of the machine from view. Bodies were quickly dissected by an array of terrifying tools. Heads with spinal cords dangling then placed in some freak show aquarium. The rest discarded like excrement.\n\nThe whole process seemed quick, but it certainly wasnt the end of things. You could see the heads in the tank still moving, eyes looking around, somehow kept alive by whatever liquid was inside.\n\nThe room was cleared with terrifying efficiency as two more harvesters joined the procedure.  I clutched my daughter and hid her eyes as they neared the last of us. \n\n*And then it all stopped...*\n\nIts been 20 years since that day. We know now that our nervous tissue was of some use to them.  We realized they left because they knew we would repopulate. And in spite of knowing they would return, thats exactly what we did. \n\n \n\n",

One of them, a tall male with black skin and wide set eyes, led us through the woods to a field a couple miles from the city. It was then that the second wave of refugees came. They appeared out of thin air in the field with the sound of a million gusts of wind. This group numbered almost 12,000, and they were in worse shape than the last. Supplies began failing in the camps. Food and water were short. Personnel couldn't keep up. Another wave three days later, this one numbering almost 50,000. They were all hungry, sick, near death. They begged in their strange language for water, and cried with happiness, cursing the 'monsters' loudly. But they didn't stop coming. Wave after wave appeared in that field. We asked them again, 'where are you coming from?'.\n\nThe man we spoke with, the leader, had learned his English quickly. He spoke with a strange accent, but it was understandable.

No one bought my hypothesis, but I knew this wasn't a naturally formed crystal.\"\n\n\"It's been two billion orbits,\" said the monitor. \"My compliments to the engineer. Oh, but you wouldn't be her.\"\n\n\"Well, no, I'm not. We found a whole cache of crystals like yours in a dig. You're basically the first real evidence we've had of a Martian civilization. And two billion Martian years about lines up with what I'd expect.\"\n\nThe monitor squinted its eye approximations. \"No, of course. You're from the third one. Fascinating. If you happen to activate more of us, they'll be pleased to know the experiment worked.\"\n\n\"What experiment is that? Brain mapping onto crystals?\"\n\n\"No, another. We sent microbes.

  "body": "Who couldve guessed that vanity would spell civilisations downfall?\n\nSo much effort had been poured into stopping the clock on aging, so many industries revolved around it, that not enough thought went into whether we actually should. Biotech giants all combined efforts, forging ahead to finally unlock the secret to freezing the aging process.\n\nIn 2031, they had their breakthrough.\n\nUnfortunately, before they could stabilise their discovery, it had a breakthrough of its own.\n\nThe antidote to aging had become an airborne virus, one that fast swept across the entire globe. Before long, the entire human population had stopped aging altogether. For the most part, people were quick to celebrate. Those few critics of what happened were drowned out by the impressionable majority, convinced that to be forever young was to be forever happy. Fools.\n\nOnly after decades had passed, after the novelty of our gift had worn off, did the harsh reality begin to set in. No new humans could be born because no embryos could grow. Since the virus yielded no true immortality, accidents and disease still claimed as many lives as they had before. The human population was plummeting.\n\nA century onwards, humanitys numbers sit in the mere hundreds. People are either killing themselves over the surplus of experiences accumulating in their heads, or demanding restitution. The scientists attempt to spin it. What better way for humanity to end than with our cities, and bodies, at their prime? But nobody's buying it. They want out of this stalemate with biology. They want a cure.\n\nAnd I found one.\n\nI thought endlessly about a solution, tossed and turned until it came to me out of nowhere. A simple procedure of sustained cellular fusion- that was all it would take to reverse the virus and get humans aging again. If my mental calculations were right, it shouldve gone off without a hitch. All I need to do, now, is the impossible.\n\nOh, Ive tried. Tried to squeal the cure to my carers with high-pitched, underdeveloped vocal cords. Tried to scribble out the theorem for passing strangers with small, feeble hands. I could have even mimed my breakthrough to the scientists themselves- if I only had the power to stand.\n\nMy mind has learned so much over the past hundred years. It really couldve saved humanity from extinction...\n\n...if only it wasnt trapped in the body of a newborn baby.",

They told us it would lead to a Golden Age of exploration, prosperity, and expansion.\n\nThey were lying.\n\nEven after the expenditure of untold billions of dollars on research and development, the world was still shocked when the first positive results came through. Faster than light travel was possible. By establishing certain quantum field configurations, engineers successfully caused a spaceship to \"jump\" over a million kilometers in a literal instant. It was on that day, supposedly, that humankind's place in the universe was forever changed. We were now a spacefaring civilization.\n\nWe exploded into interstellar space. Bolstered by a sense of global unity, we launched enormous development projects to mine exosolar planets and unveil an untold wealth of resources. We established colonies outside the solar system, and built an interstellar confederation. Armed with the jump drive, all distances were equivalent. This tool fueled an era of growth unparalleled in human history.\n\nThey told us how the drive worked. A configuration of quantum fields \"pushed\" the ship into alternate layers of spacetime, extra dimensions where superluminal transit was possible.\n\nThey were lying.\n\nI'm a theoretical physicist. I've read their papers. Their theory is bullshit.\n\nAnybody who has played a badly developed computer game has experienced \"bugs\" and \"glitches\". You might be in one room, and suddenly your character jumps to an entirely different location in the virtual world. A programming error or oversight has caused the \"physics\", if you will, of the gameworld to malfunction.\n\nFor the last ten years, I've carefully studied the mechanics of the jump drive. I can only come to one conclusion: the drive is exploiting \"glitches\" in the universe.\n\nThe physics of faster than light travel follows exactly the patterns you would expect if the universe was programmed, and the software was glitching. Project Omega, the government research program for investigating superluminal transit, was simply a study of how to exploit these glitches by creating certain specific configurations of fields and particles that would \"trigger\" the software bug.\n\nThe universe is inside a computer. And the programming apparently seems similar to that of an open-world video game.\n\nThey told us that superluminal travel was becoming ever cheaper, and soon would be available to the masses. They told us that the technological components needed to craft the jump drive were exponentially becoming inexpensive. They told us that, in the spirit of Moore's Law, the cost of FTL transit would fall every year.\n\nThey were lying.\n\nThe glitches are simply becoming more common, easier to exploit. The bugs are piling up. \n\nI've carefully studied the physics, and I can only come to one conclusion: the software is rapidly becoming a corrupted file.\n",

Four light years of empty vacuum and radiation, 35 years of exploration had taken their toll on the old ship.  She bore the marks of her journey: broken panels, dented lead shields, shattered mirrors, and scorched body.  She had finally reached its destination; she had finally arrived at Alpha Centari.  She stretched her arms to collect the warmth of a star for the first time in three and a half decades.  The sunless void connecting her home to here had drained her.\n\nThe lights sprang to life inside the crew cabin.  Long dormant electrical systems hummed in unison.  Her insides were warming; the energy reserves coursed through her systems as her nuclear heart began a faster pace.  Her crew was already moving to her bow.  It had been 35 years of darkness for them too. \nThey flew past the hydroponic crops in the central shaft.  They wore eager smiles as they climbed past water reclamation to the cockpit.  The bright face on the control panels greeted them.  It matched their elation, begging for them to confirm that their journey was over, that they had gone further than any human, that they had reached a new star.  \n\nThey checked the numbers over and over again.  They couldn't believe it.  They really made it.  Gravity signatures proved that their flight was over.  They couldn't stand it any longer.  They had to perform an EVA; they had to see the glorious star for themselves.  They drew straws: the two engineers won.  They suited up and began the depressurization process.  The others anxiously ran the numbers again and again awaiting their turns.\n\nThe two engineers stepped out from their home and peered through the depth of space.  The pilot grew nervous when she reexamined the scrolling calculations.  The engineers moved to the other side of the ship and peered again.  The pilot meticulously calculated gravitational effects by hand.  The astronauts could not see the star; they could see nothing but black.  The pilot could not see the gravity; she could only see planets with the absence of a star.  She ran more numbers. \n\nIt seemed the star had been dead for 38 years.\n",

  "body": "\"God is dead.\" People have been trying to figure out the meaning of these three words for decades. Most use it to justify their smug intellectual superiority. They think it's an exclamation of joy, of liberation from an omnipotent tyrant. But they forget the full quote: \"God is dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?\". This isn't a celebratory cry. This is an admission of guilt. \n\n\nWhen the UN declared Experimental Cybernetics inhumane and illegal, the whole world breathed a sigh of relief. We thought the great debate was over. Synths definitely weren't people, synths were abominations, and we destroyed every single last one of them. No more hyperwars, no more grandparents lost in failed uploads, no more people rendered killing machines by malfunctioning implants. Hell, even the Chinese stopped their program of mandatory visual censorship through chipping. They called it the biggest success for human rights, for the species as a whole, since we invented fire. Better yet, it was a success for the environment. To put it simply, we were running out of shit to make computers out of. Then wet tech came along.\n\n\nYou see, what we hadn't realized is that it's very hard to bend the laws of physics. It's hard to make a computer sentient, it's hard to create zero-grav, it's hard to have infinite production on a finite planet. What we did have an abundance of, though, was people. The laws of human biology, unlike physics, are completely malleable. It now it seems like there weren't any laws to begin with. Gone are the prosthetics, now we just wait a couple weeks for a cloned arm. Dead bodies are harvested for re-use, and flesh is the new steel. Some jobs have a minimum limb limit way over 4, and others require specialized senses. Worst are the hybrids, spliced monstrosities usually bred for sex or the military. Unlike cybernetics, the possibilities that come with gene-editing are truly and horrifically endless.\n\n\nThe next step, they say, is creating biological superstructures. Beating hearts the size of mountains that power cities, veins that stretch underneath the ocean for miles, digestive tracts that process materials faster than factories ever could, and all of us connected into one big throbbing, pulsing, mass. God is dead. And we killed him.",

  "body": "\"Yah, hello, this is Dave speaking.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" someone said on the other end, \"don't pick up the phone.\"\n\n\"A little late for that, don't you think?... Oh.\" The mysterious caller had hung up.\n\nThat was weird. Dave placed the phone back on its base. He would have expected this kind of pseudo-cryptic prank call at home, but at work? How did this guy even get a physics lab's number? Dumb luck, Dave guessed. He went back to his experiment.\n\nThis, was the crucial part. He was glad that little inconvenience was out of the way, for even the slightest distraction could cause a week's work to go out the window - or worse: a containment breach. He was playing with fire here and he knew it.\n\nHe touched the dial lightly. He started turning it, ever so slowly... The intricate mechanism in front of him hummed dangerously. *Soon,* he thought, *I will know whether I've made the discovery of the century... or if I just suck at math.*\n\nThe phone rang again. Anger washed over him. Of all the possible times, did it have to be now? With reserved rage, he carefully let go of the dial. After he was sure things were still functioning appropriately, he swung for the phone. \"Listen here, you god damn --\"\n\nHe bumped on a console with his elbow. Suddenly, everything around him was black.\n\nOh, no. No, no, no. He was playing with incredible energies and the repercussions of any mistake were literally unimaginable.\n\nWhat was going on? Had he died? All he could see every which way was darkness. He could hear a hollow wind blowing, but that was it.\n\n\"Hello?\" he called. \"Hello?!\" he shouted. No answer. He started walking. After a few minutes, he started running. He was panicking now.\n\nWhat was this vast emptiness?\n\nWas he ever going to make it out?\n\nHe stopped to catch his breath. He must have been running for more than 20 minutes. \"Hello?!\" he shouted once more. Nothing.\n\nSuddenly, he had a thought. He took out his cellphone. He had reception! But it was almost out of juice! He made the quick decision to call his lab.\n\n\"Yah, hello, this is Dave speaking.\"\n",

  "body": "For millennia we have observed their atrocious modus operandi. First, these carbon chauvinists approach a rocky planet orbiting its unary star inside an arbitrarily-assumed habitable zone. After breaking apart close-by comets, they bombard the planetary surface with megatonnes of frozen volatiles, drastically changing both rotation and atmosphere. Then they contaminate it with terrestrial inoculants before beginning colonisation. Since their bizarre metabolism requires highly-corrosive oxygen, they will sterilise our planet without even knowing how poisonous oxygen is. They will vendalise our structures and mine every trace of metal in the system, settling permanently while our corpses oxidise. \n\nFor millennia we have avoided contact with them, but now we are forced to move out before they arrive. After all, their species is so irrational, so erratic, so governed by hormone-induced emotions that on multiple occasions they neared self-annihilation. In fact, though they have long mastered robotics, they insist on riding sub-luminal rockets pulsed by uncontrolled thermonuclear fission, cramped behind shields with fragile life-support. They too have endangered many co-existing forms of sentience, either by feeding off their dead meat in excess or by polluting their own ecosphere. \n\nTheir inability to view from a different beings perspective is pardoned. At times they fail to do so even among themselves. Naturally they are engineered to prioritise their own self-interests over the benefit of a whole, an instinct labelled as survival of the fittest. Because of their hostile native environment, they have evolved a tendency of competing viciously against each other over limited resources, rather than sharing among the rest. Only as their booming civilisation matured did altruism develop, and even that is more of an investment. As in one invests the time and effort in another so that the favour will be returned when needed. \n\nUp till now they still segregate themselves into tribes with varying social classes, discriminating other biologically-identical races deemed inferior. The underlying logic is unfounded and this in-fighting only further proves their potential hostility. Thus we must emigrate swiftly, since they will most likely engage in conflict with us even if we display benevolence. They are, after all, notoriously violent warlords always striving to construct machinery capable of eradicating their own 1 trillion-strong population. They research constantly on genocidal techniques, advancing instruments of mass destruction to assist in combat. It is a relief such agents were rarely deployed, since in most scenarios it would lead to mutual extermination. Nevertheless, anything in these spacefaring militants path will no doubt find itself at their business end of their weapons. \n\nAnd so we are presently evacuating everybody into interstellar arks, suspended in animation for the voyage to our new residence. The transit in warp will take more than 4 generational cycles, yet none of us will age in cryogenic stasis. We will only awake once our sleeper ships enter orbit around the sun we first detected their signals, the one they designated as Sol. By then Sol would have swollen into a red giant, warming the Saturnian moon Titan to a balmy temperature. The hydrocarbon paradise would also be the universe safest haven, since they have long deserted their original birthplace. \n\nWe used to be like them, curious wanderers that almost abandoned our homeworld to forward the frontier. The difference is that unlike us, they are late to the party, and that we had already discovered faster-than-light propulsion. It was during the galactic Renaissance, when life once thrived in the intermediate region between the low-metallicity halo and high-radiation centre. However, the buffer zone was a cosmic shooting gallery not because of killer asteroids, but due to clashing cultures. Horrified, we fled home as mass extinction ensued, the Milky Way simply too bitter to conquer. \n\nAnd amid those ashes they emerged, seeing that the battlefield they expected had become a graveyard, feeling triumphant in a deathmatch they never played in. They call themselves Homo sapiens, or wise man, and us alien. These humans will never realise in reality, its vice versa. \n\nAs soon as the last of us is put to hibernation, the laser-plasma accelerators left on ground will simultaneously generate an Alcubierre metric, trapping our entire planet in a giant sunward bubble. Programmed to destabilise a nanosecond later, the warp drive will dump its payload in our host stars core, which will then collapse as it devours the mass. They will only witness the consequent supernova, not suspecting that it has been artificially accelerated to destroy all evidence of intelligence. Never will they find out about our existence, soon dwelling in their past neighbourhood. \n\nIt is implausible to wipe out an empire so vast, but isolation distress can easily drive one suicidal. For believing youre truly alone is scarier than knowing theres something out there. ",

  "body": "We had waited sixty years for their next message. Finally, the time was upon us.\n\nOur greatest technological breakthroughs had been dictated by this distant alien race. Since we received their first signal centuries ago, their vast knowledge had become ours.\n\nA cure to our deadliest diseases. Technological breakthroughs beyond our wildest imaginations. Scientific concepts our greatest minds couldn't have dreamed of. It was all in our grasp.\n\nNeither of our races had conquered faster-than-light travel. So contact was limited by the 20-light-year distance between our two planets. They had received our last response 20 years ago. Now we awaited theirs.\n\nI turned to my companion. We were the two tasked with collecting the latest message, deciphering it as quickly as possible, and relaying it to the baying crowds outside. The entire world was watching.\n\nWe waited in silence in our blank, grey room, where we had spent the last month. Our bodies were designed not to need food, or sleep, or other menial things. We simply sat there, waiting, alone.\n\nOur task was a simple one, but the enormity of it was not lost on us. We had trained our entire lives for this one moment, to ensure the message was not missed, to get as much data from it as possible.\n\nWe were global celebrities, asked to predict the message too. But our world had few ills any more. There were no wars for resources, no poverty, no lack of education, no hunger. That had begged the question, What's next? We were about to find out.\n\nTheir first signal centuries ago had sent our world into uproar. After much deliberation, we had decided to send a message back. Some had predicted this would be to our doom. What if the aliens were hostile, and wanted our world for themselves? We took a gamble. Why not? We wanted to know we were not alone  and they should know too.\n\nWe got our response 40 years later. It told how they had recently rid themselves of a deadly disease that threatened their entire race. It threatened ours, too.\n\nThat preceded our constant communication, revealing the disparity between us. While we sent primitive responses, they awed us with their technological prowess. We were given more breakthroughs, alongside tales of their culture. We learned everything about them. We even learned their language.\n\nThey were the only alien race we had made contact with. As far as we knew, we were theirs. We were seemingly the only two intelligent civilisations in the galaxy, spared an eternity of loneliness by the fortuitous placement of our worlds.\n\nMany scientists had deliberated over this odd fact. Some reasoned that our particular segment of the galaxy might be the most suitable for life, a habitable pocket in an otherwise dead galaxy. Others suggested it was a product of sampling  there were likely other races, but too distant for us to contact.\n\nOthers, inevitably, suggested a higher power was at play. Many simply resigned to never knowing the truth.\n\nThe time was nearly upon us. I looked at the other, and they looked back. We were both breathing heavily now, nervous. All the preparation in the world was not enough for this huge weight on our shoulders.\n\nOur room was silent, but I knew that outside the doors, the noise would be unbearable. The cheers, the chants, the cults, the protests.\n\nWe locked eyes again.\n\nOur brains registered the seconds tick on. It was time. An alarm sounded. The message should be here.\n\nEvery telescope in our planetary system was trained on that distant world, the third rock around a yellow dwarf star. Now, the signal would be reaching us. It would be a split second before the data arrived.\n\nWe both sat in silence a while longer. The moment passed. We waited, and waited, and waited.\n\nWhat was going on? Where was the message?\n\nPanic had not yet set in. Historically, the message had always been on time. But perhaps, for one reason or another, it was delayed. We would have to wait.\n\nAnd we did, along with the whole world. At first it was minutes. Soon it was hours. Days.\n\nWe considered our options. Protocol demanded we wait at least a month. We discussed why the message might be delayed, or what might be the cause.\n\nWhile we waited, we monitored their planet. Our most powerful telescopes could see it, albeit only minor details. But there was nothing of note. The planet still existed, we still saw the glow of their lights at night. Nothing had changed.\n\nIt was not unreasonable to assume the worst outside this room. When we had not emerged, trouble had almost certainly begun. By now, widespread riots and protests would be taking place. Our heavily guarded room could hold off an onslaught for the foreseeable future, but not forever.\n\nTime ticked on. Our bodies regulated themselves. Nanomachines kept our muscles strong. Our robotic cells re-purposed the air in our room to create nutrients. Our waste materials were broken down and recycled.\n\nFinally, we were a day short of a month. Tomorrow, we would open the doors, and address the world. We would tell them there was no message. We would face the repercussions.\n\nBefore that, we continued to study the planet. Still there was no change in its appearance. Still the continents and oceans appeared, the lights shone.\n\nLights. We both thought it. Something was odd. The lights were not constant. At night, a bright light in the southern hemisphere outshone the region. It was subtle, but observing it now with more scrutiny, it was obvious.\n\nWe looked back over the records. The flashing had begun a month ago. Morse code. A primitive cry from our only companions in the universe.\n\nGoodbye.\"\n\nA day later, the planet they called Earth went dark. We were alone.",

  "body": "12-hour flights were bad enough before the world ended.\n \nIts only been one week of this new way of living, in this flying-tin-can that comprises society, and it already feels like a lifetime. I shift uncomfortably in my seat and glance around the descending airbus. Passengers stare blankly ahead, eyes caught in the flicker of endless in-flight movies. My body is sore from the constant sitting, my skin dry and unwashed.\n\nAt least the mites arent feasting on it yet.\n\nTheir arrival changed everything. Pouring out of the ground, they bored into every living being in sight. Doors could keep them out for a few hours- but give them a day, and the mites could work their way through any defences. Their only weakness? Altitude. 3,000-feet-above-sea-level altitude. Luckily, Flight 131 was en-route when they first struck.\n\nOur plane cant stay in the air forever, though, nor can it land on a mountain. It needs to be refuelled, reserviced and restocked every time it circles the country. The original cabin crew gave us all the information we needed to know, along with a heavy handbook and their lives. Each landing, a new handful of passengers are randomly selected from the manifest to upkeep the plane.\n\nNow is my turn.\n\nI stand, my legs quivering like a newborn foals, and walk the aisle to my death. The wave of carnivorous insects quickly swarms me as I disembark the stationary plane along with two other passengers. Im so focused on the refuelling equipment that I dont immediately notice the mites sloughing away at me. Ever-so-surely, the pain sets in- the insatiable grey cloud competing with my efforts to refuel our airborne ark.\n\nCompleting the finishing touches, I question whether our sacrifices are even worth it. Will this pestilence go away one day, or are we only delaying the inevitable? I guess if Flight 131 doesnt hold out, then well never know.\n\nMy skin is now completely eaten. I cant ignore it as the mites have consumed my eyelids. All over my body is bare, red muscle tissue, every drop of blood wicked away instantly. I dont have long left. Job finished, we stand back and watch the last vestiges of humanity ascend back into the sky, without us. Despite the agony of my certain demise, Im at peace. It feels good to have both feet on the ground...\n\n...before the mites devour them.",

  "body": "William Sage wrote over 3500 short stories in his 27-years on this Earth, and never once was he published. Every Thursday he mailed thick envelopes destined for *Astounding Science Fiction!* and *Weird Tales* and the prose portions of *Playboy*, but for all the money he spent on stamps he only ever received form-letter rejections and short notes summarized as Thanks but no thanks. In defense of the editors, Williams writing was objectively bad. His English was poor, his grammar all wrong, and he bucked the trends of Martian invasions and intergalactic space odysseys and instead wrote of everyday people and everyday lives right here on our own mundane planet. If something exciting did happen, his banal, forgettable characters had no part in it, only seeing it on the news and then going about their days. To William, characters were just human anchors for his longwinded ramblings of tomorrows world.\n\nHe dreamed up fighter planes with no pilots that perpetually bombed nations across the world. He warned of pharmacies running drug rackets in every town, hollowing out America from within. He envisaged farm animals stuffed into smaller and smaller pens, describing in calm detail the finish line of efficiency. He conjured up inventions like undersea cables connecting information across the world, and listening devices willingly carried in the pockets of every adult, and screens housing lifetimes of pornography that kept the people docile, and an encyclopaedia penned by each of us that could answer any question ever asked.\n\nThe editors used to laugh when they received his short fiction in the mail, with unimaginative titles like January 9th, 2007 and September 11th, 2001 and June 23rd, 2018. They would read passages to each other with tears in their eyes, lambasting the silliness of his premises, and the pointless dialogue, and the spelling mistakes so numerous they never bothered to circle them. And when one day he stopped submitting, they briefly wondered what had happened to their weekly delivery of bad fiction, but assumed that William had either given up or died and soon forgot about him entirely.\n\nIn reality, a truck had hit William as he walked to the mailbox and he had fallen into a coma. Right now he was in a hospital bed, with expensive machines beeping lullabies to him and a tired mother holding his hand.\n\nEven though he couldnt write, William still dreamed of the far away future, more vividly than ever before. He imagined he was a stranger in a time where all his many tales intersected. The stranger was reading about the author of this world on a small, bright screen, and then suddenly stopped to notice  the cracks in every seam of existence. But upon peering closer, Williams mind would neatly fill them in, and then placate the stranger with a wave of recognition. It had always been this way. It all made sense. Comforted, the stranger soon pushed away any worries and carried on with life.\n\nWilliam liked this world. He didnt want to leave it. But he knew that one day he would either wake or die.\n\nHe wondered what would happen to the stranger when he did.",
